MONITORING AND PARENTAL CONTROLS, I have heard of a variety of programs that can be used to monitor for and block sensitive content online. One example is Bark. Are these types of programs recommended? Is one better than another? Are there any risks to using these apps as another line of defense against inappropriate content online?,AAP,"Based on existing research, we recommend alternatives to parental control apps, like online safety plans that rely on parenting strategies that promote better teen self-regulation, incorporate family input in the rule-setting process and facilitate learning.

Teens should ideally be learning how to make responsible decisions on their own about the content they interact with online, and relying on restrictive rules or monitoring technologies makes it harder for them to problem-solve and develop the autonomy they need to navigate digital technology in ways that support their development.

It is understandable that parents want to limit the risks posed to their children when online. One way to do this is to create guidelines and household rules for technology use that can decrease the amount of time adolescents spend online and provide them with strategies for what to do when they come across risky content, but that does not seem to decrease children’s exposure to online risks.

Unfortunately, existing parental control apps do not support the developmental process of adolescents because they often fail to balance parental values and desires with their children’s own values, needs, and wants. Consider that 89% of features on parental online safety apps are targeted specifically toward parental control, while only 11% of features on these apps support some form of teen self-regulation.

What Parents Can Do

How do I monitor my kids' cell phone use without seeming intrusive? and Why the Best Parental Control Is You demonstrate why it's important to be transparent with adolescents about implementing monitoring apps. Communication is key when it comes to technology and adolescents; down the line this will teach adolescents how to make responsible decisions on their own.    
Have open, transparent communication about adolescent Internet-use and family expectations.
Children are more likely to follow rules when they have the opportunity to provide input and discuss their concerns about online safety.
Close relationships between parents and their children are associated with fewer online risk-taking behaviors in adolescents.
Let them know that “the internet is a really big place, and sometimes you can run into gross, mean, upsetting or sexual content – if this happens, you can always come talk to me about it, and you won’t be in trouble.”
Create a family online safety plan.
The Family Media Plan tool contains a section on Safety that can be used as a guide. Consistent with AAP recommendations, we recommend household rules focused on content, communication and co-viewing.
Talk with your child about the importance of using strong privacy settings and walk through setting up those settings on their devices together.
Discuss what steps they should take if they find inappropriate content, are contacted by strangers, or feel uncomfortable or unsafe online.
For parents who would like to use parental monitoring technology, Common Sense Media provides the Parent's Ultimate Guide to Parental Controls that displays options for monitoring and blocking content that include specific apps (like Bark, Circle, etc.), managing devices on Wi-Fi networks and editing system preferences within social media apps.
If parental controls are used, we recommend using them in combination with open communication and as a part of a family online safety plan.

MONITORING AND PARENTAL CONTROLS,How do I monitor my kids' cell phone use without seeming intrusive?,Common Sense,"Parents: If you want to monitor your kid's cell phone without seeming intrusive, be honest about what you're doing and why. Explain that your rules are for their safety and protection. It's a parents' job to make sure kids are using their devices appropriately. Some parents say, ""If I'm paying for it, I'm entitled to read my kids' texts, check their call logs, and know who their friends are."" That's valid, but kids consider these devices to be as personal as diaries, so tread cautiously. Spot checks are a good idea. You know your kid best. If you sense something isn't right, spot-check more often.

MONITORING AND PARENTAL CONTROLS,How do I decide which parental controls to use?,Common Sense,"A lot of us don't think about parental controls until after something bad happens (your kid stumbles onto porn, you get into a shouting match over screen time, a group chat goes off the rails). Even if nothing has happened yet, you know it's just a matter of time. In these situations, shutting everything down (what we call the Nuclear Option) feels like the only choice. But in reality, what most of us want—and need—is simple: an extra set of eyes and ears on our kids as they venture into the online world. Still, a just-right solution can be hard to nail down. You can find it, though. Whether it's tools, talking points, or a combination of both, we'll help you figure out what tech you need—and what you don't.

Quick Take
The best parental control is you. Set clear expectations, be consistent, and talk about what your kids are doing, who they're talking to online, and how they're feeling about it.

Start with free options. Turn on Google SafeSearch, use Screen Time if you have an iPhone, use Family Link if you have Android, and look at the settings on all your devices and services to see which built-in parental controls are already available.

Parental controls are handy, but not perfect. While they can block inappropriate content, impose screen limits, and more, they can be a pain to manage, kids can get around them, and they can even damage your relationship.

Play the long game. Your ultimate goal is for your kids to learn responsibility and self-regulation, and that takes time and, sometimes, struggle.

What are all the different kinds of parental controls?
Parental controls cover a wide range of functions, from simple content filters to fee-based solutions that let you manage every device on your network. Depending on your kid's age, the type of device(s) you have, and the level of supervision you can devote to your kid's online activities, you can pick and choose the kind of coverage you need. Here are your options:

Search filters. SafeSearch in Google is a first line of defense against exposure to inappropriate content, and all parents should take this basic precaution. You can also use kid-specific browsers such as Kiddle that return only age-appropriate results.

Time limits. Most devices let you set time limits for a total amount of screen time on that device as well as time limits for individual apps. You can usually find this feature in the device's settings. Some apps, such as YouTube Kids and TikTok, offer time limits within the app's settings.

Content blockers. These prevent kids from accessing entire categories of content called ""domains,"" such as all porn sites, all gaming sites, or entertainment sites. You can find this feature in the free parental control OpenDNS and in fee-based products such as Net Nanny and Qustodio.

Download and purchasing limits. These settings prevent kids from buying games, music, apps, and other content based on age ratings or permission settings. You usually manage this in the device itself.

Social media and text monitors. These services keep an eye on what your kid is doing on social media and SMS and give you a report on their activities. They also alert you when suspicious words are used. You need your kid's social media info (log-ins and passwords) for them to work. They cost money because they're monitoring your kid's apps in real time. Bark and Qustodio are two popular social media monitoring programs.

Location trackers. Apps such as Life360 and Find My tell you where your kid is. They don't work when the phone is turned off, when it has location turned off, or when the battery is drained.

Home and mobile all-in-one solutions. Some parental controls allow you to manage everything connected to your network. First check the software that comes with your internet router (more on that below) to see if it has built-in parental controls. Otherwise, consider an easy-to-use hardware device such as Circle Home Plus or check to see whether your internet service provider (ISP) offers this service. AT&T, Comcast, and Verizon all have parental control apps.

What's the right solution for me?
Every family's needs are different. While it's important to make sure you're talking to your kid about healthy online habits, balancing their online time with offline activities, and staying attuned to potential behavior issues, sometimes you need tech support to back you up. Here are some common device-use scenarios most families face and sample tech solutions.

""My kid doesn't have a phone but uses mine sometimes, and I'm able to supervise most of their screen time.""
Make sure Google SafeSearch is enabled in all the browsers you use (as long as you're signed in, the settings will apply across all your devices).
Add limits to your own phone: If you have an iPhone, use Screen Time and especially review the settings in the Content & Privacy Restrictions and Always Allowed sections. If you have an Android phone, set up Family Link (in Settings) on your phone.
""My kid doesn't have a phone yet but wants more independence on our connected devices (tablet, laptop, desktop) and I can't supervise it all.""
Enable SafeSearch on all browsers.
Try the parental controls built into your device's operating system. Every operating system—Windows, Mac OS, Android, Fire, or Mac iOS—has some built-in parental controls, which you can find in the device's settings. Usually you can set screen time limits for days of the week, add content filters, and more. Most OSs require you to create individual user profiles for each family member in order to enable these restrictions. Your kid needs to log in to their own account for them to work.
""My kid needs to use devices for homework, and I want to block distracting stuff like YouTube, games, and social media but allow them to access what they need to for school.""
Determine whether the device's operating system has built-in parental controls that will work for your needs. If not, you may need to spend money on one of the options below.
Invest in an all-in-one parental control software package such as Net Nanny or the Circle Home Plus hardware solution. They cost extra, but could be worth it if you're struggling to keep your kid on task but don't want to block sites they need for research.
Download an app designed to keep kids focused and limit distractions, such as a timer, a goal setter, or a task manager.
""My kid won't get off their video games.""
If you have a console such as Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch, you can enable time limits and even block the game that's causing problems directly on those devices.
If your kid is playing on a PC or mobile device, you can set time limits and block access in the device's settings.
You may have parental controls in your router software that let you shut off the game console, block the game, or eliminate access to all games. Routers from Asus, Linksys, Netgear, and others have highly rated parental control options. You can access your router software on your main home computer, or Google its name and follow the instructions for setting up parental controls.
If your ISP offers online tools or an app, use it to turn off the internet for a while.
""My kid has a phone, and I want to block mature content, prevent downloads, and limit their screen time.""
Use Screen Time for iPhones or the Family Link app for Android phones.
If you want to add social media and text monitoring to their phones, consider an app such as Bark, which offers real-time activity reports and danger alerts.
""My kid sneaks their phone into their bedroom at night.""
Collect phones and charge them in your room at night.
Use Screen Time (iPhones) or Family Link (Android phones) to enable Downtime or Bedtime until the next morning.
Turn off the Wi-Fi and the data using your router software, or, literally, press the ""Off"" button on your router.
Do parental controls really work?
From a technical standpoint? Yes. But the jury is still out on whether they're really effective. The tools can be confusing to figure out and time-consuming to manage. Parental controls are kind of blunt instruments designed to solve problems with many variables. And sometimes, for seemingly no reason at all, they don't work; a software update, for example, can throw everything off. Finally, studies on parental controls indicate that they can harm the parent-kid dynamic enough to make them a complicated choice. And:

There's no proof parental controls actually protect kids. Do kids see less inappropriate material because they have parental controls enabled? No one knows.

They can erode trust. When kids feel like you don't trust them, they might shut down, stop communicating, and engage in secretive behavior.

They can give you a false sense of security. Parental controls can make you feel like you're doing your job. But kids can defeat them, which sets up an unproductive game of cat and mouse. They work best with open, honest communication to ensure your kid learns to manage their own use, make good choices, and become a productive digital citizen.

Ultimately, the best parental control is you.

A combination of modeling a healthy approach to devices, and discussing media and tech use over time, on multiple occasions, will help kids regulate themselves and build skills to carry into adulthood. When you say things like, ""Remember to think before you post,"" ""Don't talk to strangers on the internet,"" and ""Use strong privacy settings""—followed up with why it's important—they'll remember. And if you need some assistance from technology, there's no shame in that. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-decide-which-parental-controls-to-use",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-decide-which-parental-controls-to-use

Every kid knows it's a cinch to change passwords, create a new account you don't know about, or simply block you from ever seeing anything he or she posts.

",My 12-year-old complains of being tired and I’m worried that their screen time is affecting their sleep.,AAP,"Sleep is so important for your child’s development, so you’re right to be concerned. Not getting enough sleep can have a negative impact on a child’s performance at school and their mental health. It can also be associated with obesity.  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children between 6 and 13 years old get 9-11 hours of sleep a night. Teens age 14-17 years should aim for 8-10 hours per night.  

Studies show that the quality and the consistency of an adolescent’s sleep is just as important to their overall health as the amount. Using a screen can affect the quality of your child’s sleep by making them more alert and raising their heart rate, especially if your child is playing an action-packed video game or watching something intense. This can make it harder for them to fall asleep. The type of light given off by screens can also disrupt the production of a sleep hormone called melatonin. Here are some tips to help your child get a good night’s sleep.",https://www.aap.org/en/patient-care/media-and-children/center-of-excellence-on-social-media-and-youth-mental-health/qa-portal/qa-portal-library/qa-portal-library-questions/screen-time-affecting-sleep/

",How are screens affecting my kid's sleep?,Common Sense,"""Sleep is one of those things that—once we made it past diapers and naps—we thought would get easier. And for you lucky parents whose kids go to bed at the same time every night and wake up bright and cheerful: nice work. For most of us, though, sleep is an ongoing challenge, especially as kids get older.

Our kids are tired.

Despite the recommendation that kids need as much as 9 to 12 hours of sleep a night, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reports that 75% of teens get less than 7 hours a night. And devices definitely play a role: New research from Common Sense found a whopping 69% of teens now take their mobile devices to bed—with 29% actually sleeping with them, and 36% being awakened by notifications in the night. Screen time usually doesn't stop in the hour before bed, even though doctors recommend it. Seventy percent of teens report checking their mobile device within 30 minutes of falling asleep.

We know the dangers: Without enough sleep, kids could be more at risk for obesity, poor academic performance, unsafe behaviors like smoking or drinking, and even depression. But it's not an easy problem to solve. As kids get older, there's more homework, more extracurricular activities, and more socializing outside of school. Plus, school starts SO early.

How do screens affect sleep?

When it comes to screens and sleep, there are three main problems:

Blue light interrupts natural sleep rhythms. Blue light from the sun tells us when to wake up. The highly concentrated form emitted from screens does the same thing.
Just using a device is stimulating. Using screens in the hour before bed makes it harder to fall asleep because it keeps the brain alert when it should be winding down.
Devices have invaded the bedroom. When homework happens online and phones never leave our sides, it's increasingly difficult to keep bedrooms screen-free zones.
So what can we do to help kids get enough sleep?

Doctors call the practice of having a regular bed and wake time, along with a quiet and cool place to sleep, """"good sleep hygiene."""" These days, a healthy bedtime routine includes cutting out screens. Here are our basic recommendations:

Limit screen use before bed. Whenever possible, shut everything off—including TVs—at least an hour before bedtime.
Ban screens from bedrooms at night. Kids may fight you on this one. Especially if they've been using their phones as alarms or to listen to music before bed. Stand your ground! Bust out the old-fashioned alarm clock and boom box. Smart speakers can also be a solution.
Block the blue light. Make sure kids are using """"dark mode"""" on their devices if they absolutely must use them within an hour of sleep. Blue light blocking glasses or apps that filter it out could also be helpful.
Shut off notifications. If taking phones away at night is too much of a battle, or just impractical, make sure kids shut off their notifications at night. You can use built-in features like Apple's Screen Time or Android's Family Link to control them yourself.
Turn off the Wi-Fi. Use a Family Media Agreement to create a rule that all devices and Wi-Fi turn off at a specific hour. Internet service providers, routers, and parental control hardware like Circle Home Plus make shutting off everything easy. (Check out the Ultimate Guide to Parental Controls for more info.)
Walk the walk. Honestly, this is the hardest step. Our research shows that parents are also guilty of sleeping with their devices and being woken up by notifications. But if you ask your kid to charge their phone in the kitchen while yours stays at your bedside, it can be difficult for them to listen.
How to deal with specific situations.

Maybe you have your sleep routine down pat. Screens off. Teeth brushed. Books read. But then something comes and throws a wrench into the whole plan. We've got some tips:

Summers and holidays

Kids need a break from the pressures of school, no doubt. But staying up all night watching YouTube or playing Fortnite isn't going to do anyone any good. Try shifting bedtime an hour or two later, max, as long as they can make up the sleep in the morning.

School stress and homework

If you've got a highly motivated kid, you can remind them that sleep is actually going to help them perform better on tests. Then set devices and Wi-Fi to go off at an agreed upon hour. If they need to finish an essay, suggest they find time at lunch or study hall.

Friends are online late

When the other kids are up late on a group chat or playing video games, it makes it doubly difficult to pry your kid off the device. Our best advice is to talk to other parents and suggest a cut-off time for games or texts.

Friend drama

Kids use their devices to bond with friends—just like we used the telephone when we were young. But putting a stop to communication can be a relief for kids embroiled in social dramas. Be flexible enough that if it seems like a friend truly needs support, you'll allow an extra 30 minutes of chat time (encourage a phone call or FaceTime for deeper empathy).

Obsessed with game/app

A new game or app (Fortnite, anyone?) that demands lots of playtime to level up can make kids want to play for hours—even past their bedtime. Some kids wait for parents to go to sleep and then jump on the Xbox. Hide the controllers or use parental controls to shut off Wi-Fi or devices.

Anxiety/depression

Kids who are suffering with mental health issues can find lots of support online. But research is very clear that a lack of sleep makes anxiety and depression worse. So give kids time online (and in real life!) to connect with friends and access resources, but protect the sleep of vulnerable kids with extra vigilance. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-are-screens-affecting-my-kids-sleep""",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-are-screens-affecting-my-kids-sleep

",How do screens -- such as TV and smartphones -- affect my kids’ sleep?,Common Sense,"While the connection between poor sleep and bedroom TVs is well-established, the effect of small screens -- smartphones, iPods, tablets, or other small-screen devices -- on kids' sleep hasn't been studied until recently. A report released in 2017 by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that they're just as worrisome – but for different reasons than TVs.

Television's glare and audio volume obviously robs kids of sleep, but a small screen can inhibit sleep in other ways: by occupying kids when they should be sleeping, keeping their brains and bodies alert with interactivity, throwing off their natural sleep rhythm, and interrupting sleep with notifications. In the study, kids reported not sleeping as well and feeling as though they didn't get enough rest when they snoozed near a small screen.

A lot of attention has been paid to the issue of blue light -- the high-energy, short-wavelength light that's present in sunlight but hyper-concentrated in device displays. Blue light interferes with our natural sleep rhythms and researchers are examining how much device use late at night impacts kids' sleep due to blue light specifically. Some say a lot, some say a little. But most experts agree that regardless of the blue light, devices cause sleep disruption just by being present in the room where you're trying to sleep.

Evidence is mounting that a longer duration of sleep is actually more important for teens than little kids, due to the physical and cognitive growth spurts in this phase of development. Staying up too late can make kids cranky -- but there are real health risks, too. Obesity, poor school performance, even behavioral problems can stem from inadequate sleep. Parents of tweens and teens need to really double down on making sure everyone is getting enough sleep -- and that often means grappling with device use, which keeps everyone up later. Unfortunately, even though we know we should stricter about kids' device use and our own and maintaining consistent, device-free, bedtime routines, we're slacking. If you're not familiar with the recommended daily amount of sleep for each age, it's sobering to read the American Academy of Pediatrics' guidelines.

Having good ""sleep hygiene"" is critical to overall well-being, and it's something parents should do their best to model . It's not always possible to clear the bedroom of all screens -- but instruct your kids to turn them off, download apps that disable the device at bedtime, and charge devices in your room at night to help your kids get the rest they need. And of course, make sure you're getting the sleep you need, too. Your kids will pick up on your habits (and you'll rest better, too). https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-screens-such-as-tv-and-smartphones-affect-my-kids-sleep",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-screens-such-as-tv-and-smartphones-affect-my-kids-sleep

",Teens and Sleep: What parents don't know about sleep,Ask Lisa,"Technology use, especially in the evening, can delay the time when teens feel sleepy due to the blue light emitted by screens, which affects melatonin production. Melatonin is the hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles, and its delayed release can push back sleep onset times for teens.

Activities on electronic devices, such as social media interaction, playing video games, or texting, are engaging and stimulating. This can make it harder for teens to wind down and transition into sleep mode.

They recommend that teens disengage from electronic devices at least one hour before bedtime. This helps in reducing blue light exposure and decreases stimulation from interactive activities.

Instead of screen-based activities, they suggest other calming activities such as reading a physical book, listening to a podcast (without looking at a screen), or engaging in relaxation exercises like yoga or meditation.

For teens who might need to use devices late in the evening, it is suggested to use features like night shift modes on devices, which adjust the screen to emit warmer light, or to use blue light blocking glasses. These measures can help mitigate some of the negative impacts of blue light on sleep.",https://drlisadamour.com/resource/teens-and-sleep-with-journalist-author-lisa-l-lewis/

SEXUAL/PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT,At what age do you talk to your child about online pornography exposure and how to do so in a way that is developmentally appropriate.,AAP,"Unintentional exposure to pornographic images and videos online becomes more common in the teen years. Through surveys, we know that about 15% of kids report that they first saw pornography under age 11 and 20-38% of kids aged 11-17 years old report seeing pornography online in the last year. Therefore, you should start talking to kids about the fact that they may sometimes see disturbing things online when they are starting to use the internet independently (usually around elementary school age). You can keep the conversation more general, such as “the internet is a really big place, and sometimes you can run into gross, mean, upsetting, or sexy stuff (depending on the age of your child, you may want to define or clarify “sexy” as adult or inappropriate content that could include images or video of naked people or private parts) – if this happens, you can always come talk to me about it, and you won’t be in trouble.” Kids underreport porn exposure to their parents, likely out of embarrassment, so it’s good to set the expectation that they can come to you.

What Parents Can Do:
First, recognize that while pornography is one of many inappropriate things kids can find online, it is the one that parents probably dread talking about the most! So use this as an opportunity to let your kids know that they can come to you about anything disturbing or upsetting that they see online.
It helps to check your own reaction and not blame, shame, or punish kids for viewing pornography or pretend it didn’t happen. Studies have shown that teens with worse parent-child relationships and parents who have more of an authoritarian (“my way or the highway”) style are more likely to intentionally seek out porn, so it can help to not overreact or make your child feel ashamed.
Look into ways to put filters or blocks on adult content on devices. Although we couldn’t find any research that this protects kids from porn exposure, it is better than having your child’s device open to everything!

Talking about sex feels uncomfortable for lots of parents – but it is important to know that communicating about sexual development with kids is not the same as giving them a “green light” to have sex! In fact, adolescents who rate their communication with parents positively are less likely to be sexually active. Here are some good tips for how to talk with children about sex in developmentally appropriate ways.
This is a great blog written by Brown clinical psychology researcher Jacqueline Nesi PhD, who encourages parents to use the acronym SEX ED to guide conversations with children. S – set the scene, ask questions, provide a definition. E – encourage further conversation, normalize curiosity, remind them they can talk to you. X – eXpress your values about sex and porn. E – educate, tell them that porn is not realistic or a good way to learn about sex. D – Direct to other resources (books, podcasts, websites). She includes talking points for each letter of the acronym SEX ED and how to go about each part.

SEXUAL/PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT,How do I talk to my kid about posting sexy stuff online?,Common Sense,"You know what's hard? Talking to your kid about sex and sexuality—especially as they're slowly transforming from little kids into moody, obnoxious soon-to-be teenagers. I spoke with Shafia Zaloom—health educator and author of Sex, Teens, and Everything in Between—about how to approach these conversations. We talked about how using media—from TV to Twitter—can be a great jumping-off point for discussing sex. And then we dove into a scenario I hear about often from parents of tweens who are just starting to explore on social media.

Sierra: A 10-year-old will be at their friend's house. They're scrolling through TikTok videos, and they decide, ""Oh, let's make our own."" And they think, ""OK, the way that you do that is by wearing a short little top and dancing around""—because that's what they've seen. They're exploring and being cute … but for parents—they're kind of freaked out. How do we help parents through that situation?

Shafia: It's a real opportunity for us as parents to engage in ongoing conversation about how the digital space is an extension of our personal space, and that understanding our behavior in that space is really important. And we do this all the time as parents. We're constantly talking to kids about code-switching and reading context and then managing our behavior and self-regulating appropriately. How you behave and how we talk to each other at our grandparents' holiday dinner table is going to be different than when you're kicking it with your friends in the family room at your house, right?

SF: Right.

SZ: Help them deconstruct the greater culture as it's represented in those images that they try to emulate. A lot of it has to do with attention—garnering attention and what it feels like to get attention. They are neurologically programmed in those middle school preadolescent/adolescent years to seek the attention and the approval of their friends. So bringing that to their attention and helping them deconstruct media and understand its impact is an important first step.

SF: What next?

SZ: When it comes to sexuality, I think it's an opportunity to say, ""I notice."" I love ""I notice"" because there's no judgment in it and we're merely making observations. [You can say:] ""I notice you trying on different kinds of positions and clothing and ways in which you're expressing your sexuality. What is it that you're actually going for? Do you feel like that aligns with the values that we've been trying to teach? Where else are you seeing this and how does it contribute to your social life?"" I think those are all really important questions. Just get really curious as a parent.

SF: What are some techniques you use that parents could emulate to get their kids to feel comfortable talking about tricky topics?

SZ: Our approach is always important. Becoming curious. Let kids become the expert. Talk less, listen more. Engage in these conversations in kid time, and for teenagers and preadolescents that's usually a little later than our bedtime. [Laughs] That's when they tend to open up. They're smart—they know that when we're tired, we'll talk less and listen more.

SF: What do kids say is the best way for parents to talk about this stuff?

SZ: Their advice to parents is to avoid it becoming a lecture, because kids shut down. Avoid it becoming a family debate, because then there's a right or wrong—and kids are allergic to that, because they want to be making decisions for themselves and figuring out who they are as independent beings. And so if it's more exploratory than black and white, it's helpful. And to not be afraid to say, ""I don't know."" Role model healthy vulnerability for your kid—it shows that you're not going to be always right, that your kid can actually engage in conversation where you will consider their point of view, where they're not going to be judged, where they can actually explore with their parents and share with open honesty.

SF: Influencing tweens' and teens' behavior online—especially when it comes to expressing their sexuality—is subtle. Not necessarily about strict rules?

SZ: Ultimately what we're doing is preparing them to be able to be independent and self-regulating and have autonomy in the digital space in a way that has integrity. So that takes time, and we have to let them figure that out and exercise some of their independence and explore on their own.

Beyond the conversation
You are definitely the best source of information for your kid when it comes to sex. And only you can pass along your beliefs and values. But it's a good idea for kids to have other trustworthy sources for sex information in case they're embarrassed to ask you. Books are great—especially ones slyly stashed on your kid's bedroom bookshelf. But there are some great apps, shows, and websites that also offer fact-based, judgment-free information that kids can explore on their own. Here are some of our editors' favorites:

Amaze.org (website)

Available as a website and YouTube channel, Amaze provides ""medically accurate, age-appropriate, affirming, and honest sex education."" They also offer Amaze Jr. for parents and kids age 4 to 9.

It's Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex, and Sexual Health (book)

An unflinching and fully illustrated guide to sexual health for older tweens and teens that presents sexual activity as enjoyable but requiring mature, careful decision-making. For younger kids, It's So Amazing tackles sex without getting into all the details.

Sex-Ed School (YouTube series)

A series of YouTube videos hosted by a sex educator and sex researcher and aimed at demystifying sex for young people age 9 to 12.

Sex, Etc. (website)

Mostly written by teens, for teens, this website backed by Rutgers University includes frank, fact-based information about anatomy, safer sex, resisting sexual pressure, pregnancy options, sexual orientation, and a range of other issues related to sexual health and relationships. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-talk-to-my-kid-about-posting-sexy-stuff-online",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-talk-to-my-kid-about-posting-sexy-stuff-online
SEXUAL/PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT,"What should I do when my teen posts a sexy ""selfie""?",Common Sense,"The advent of social media means that teens aren't just passive consumers of the media's messages; they're creating and sharing images of their own. All over the Web, you can find ""selfies"": photos kids take of themselves in silly or provocative poses. Whether on YouTube or Facebook, many girls now feel more pressure to be ""camera-ready"" -- as if to say that the only way to be valued is to appear sexy.

The teen years are all about experimentation and the search for identity. A lot of times, the impulse to broadcast sexy photos is driven by the desire to get attention. Ask your teens whether they want to get attention by being provocative or by being themselves. Help them understand how certain choices make them feel. Here are some more ways to help teens develop a healthy self-image:

Offer positive role models. Get your two cents in about whom your kids idolize or find pretty in the media. Without being heavy-handed, talk about other people you find beautiful who are all different body types -- and say why.

Help your kid become a media critic. Pay attention to ads, magazine covers, and billboards. Then talk to your kids about how these messages make you feel, and ask them about their reactions.

Expose the myths. Make sure kids know that celebrities have stylists, hairdressers, personal trainers, and more all working to make them look polished. Point out that pictures in magazines have been altered to make models look flawless -- and impossibly thin. Even better, show them just how much work goes into a cover shot by watching the short ""Evolution"" film produced by the Dove Campaign for Real Beauty. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-do-when-my-teen-posts-a-sexy-selfie",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-do-when-my-teen-posts-a-sexy-selfie
SEXUAL/PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT,My Kid Looked at Porn. What Should I Do? ,Ask Lisa,"In the episode titled ""ENCORE: My Kid Looked at Porn. What Should I Do?"" from the Ask Lisa Podcast, Dr. Lisa Damour discusses a complex issue many parents face with their children encountering inappropriate content online. Here are the steps and strategies she recommends:
Stay Calm and Collected: Reacting immediately in shock or anger can close off lines of communication. Take a moment to collect yourself and approach the situation thoughtfully.
Open the Conversation Gently: Acknowledge that it's normal for kids to be curious about sex, but explain that the content found in pornography is not a healthy or realistic depiction of sexual relationships.
Inquire About Their Experience: Ask your child what they saw and how they felt about it. This can give you insights into their thought process and feelings about the content.
Educate About the Content: Explain the nature of pornography as being designed for adult entertainment, often emphasizing unrealistic and unhealthy behaviors. Stress that it does not represent real-life relationships or sexual experiences.
Set Expectations and Boundaries: Discuss the importance of responsible internet use. Make clear what types of websites are inappropriate and outline the consequences of visiting such sites.
Implement Safety Measures: Use parental controls and monitoring tools to help prevent access to inappropriate content. Discuss these measures with your child so they understand it’s about safety, not distrust.
Provide Alternatives for Learning: Offer resources appropriate for their age to satisfy their curiosity about sex, such as books or educational programs, and be open to discussing any questions they might have.
Reassure and Support: Let your child know that while they might encounter confusing or upsetting content, they can always come to you with questions or concerns without fear of punishment.
Regularly Revisit the Conversation: Keep the lines of communication open. As your child grows, their understanding and exposure will change, requiring ongoing conversations about these topics.
Seek Professional Guidance if Needed: If you’re unsure how to handle the situation or if your child seems particularly distressed by what they’ve seen, consider seeking advice from a mental health professional.
Dr. Damour emphasizes the importance of not panicking and recognizing that while exposure to pornography is not ideal, it can be a catalyst for important conversations about sex, consent, and relationships. https://drlisadamour.com/resource/encore-my-kid-looked-at-porn-what-should-i-do/",https://drlisadamour.com/resource/encore-my-kid-looked-at-porn-what-should-i-do/
SEXUAL/PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT,Sexy Social Media. Where Should Parents Draw the Line?,Ask Lisa,"Here are some practical guidelines or tips for parents on navigating conversations about social media use with their teenagers, as recommended by Lisa Damour in the podcast:
Start with Understanding: Recognize that behaviors like posting suggestive content on social media are very common among teenagers. Understand that this is a part of how they explore identity and social dynamics, especially in an era where physical social interactions might be limited.
Approach Conversations with Curiosity: When discussing social media content with your teenager, approach the conversation without judgment. Ask open-ended questions like, ""What do you think about that video?"" or ""How do you feel about the comments people are making?"" This helps open a dialogue where your child feels respected and heard.
Educate on the Impact of Content: Discuss the potential long-term implications of the content they post. Highlight how certain images and videos might be perceived by others, including peers and adults, and the possible consequences of having a digital footprint.
Discuss Online Attention and Approval: Talk about the reasons behind the desire for online approval, such as likes and comments. Explore the psychological effects of seeking validation through social media and encourage your child to find validation in real-life interactions and achievements as well.
Set Boundaries and Explain Why: Clearly define what is acceptable in your family for posting on social media. Explain why these boundaries are set, not just that they must be followed. Discuss the values behind these rules to help your teenager understand and accept them.
Promote a Balanced Self-Image: Encourage your child to engage in activities that promote a well-rounded self-image that is not solely dependent on online personas. This can include offline hobbies, sports, and educational pursuits that foster a sense of accomplishment and self-worth.
Monitor and Discuss Public Comments: Talk about the nature of public comments on social media. Discuss how to handle negative or inappropriate comments and the importance of not engaging in or encouraging such behavior.
Use Teachable Moments: If your child posts something questionable, use it as a teachable moment rather than a time for punishment. Discuss why the post might be concerning and explore alternatives that allow them to express themselves in a more appropriate way.
Apologize When Necessary: If you overreact to your child’s social media use, apologize. This shows that you respect their feelings and are open to communication. It also models responsible behavior in acknowledging mistakes.
Keep the Conversation Going: Make discussions about social media an ongoing dialogue rather than a one-time talk. Regular check-ins can help you understand your child's evolving views and experiences online.",https://drlisadamour.com/resource/sexy-social-media-where-should-parents-draw-the-line/
SEXUAL/PORNOGRAPHIC CONTENT,My Daughter’s Nude Selfie Got Out. What Do We Do Now?,Ask Lisa,"In the podcast episode, Lisa provides advice for a parent dealing with the aftermath of a nude photo incident involving their daughter. Here's a summarized version of the steps and considerations Lisa recommends:
Empathy and Support:
Lisa stresses the importance of showing empathy and love for the daughter, acknowledging her mistake but also recognizing that the incident has happened and can't be changed. She suggests supporting the daughter through this tough time rather than focusing on reprimands.
Handling the Spread of the Photo:
If the photo is still being circulated, Lisa mentions that there might be steps to take to address this issue, though specifics aren't detailed in this part of the conversation.
Legal Considerations:
Lisa discusses the complex legal landscape surrounding the sharing of nude photos among minors, which varies by state. Some states might treat such actions under child pornography laws, leading to potential legal consequences. She advises understanding the legal implications in one's state before seeking formal recourse.
School Involvement:
The complexity of involving the school is acknowledged, especially given the legal implications. Lisa suggests that this is a delicate decision that needs careful consideration, potentially requiring legal advice depending on the state laws.
Communication with the Other Parent:
Lisa advises that the mother should follow her daughter's lead regarding whether to communicate with the boy's parents. It's crucial that the daughter feels in control of how the situation is handled to avoid additional stress.
Long-term Recovery:
Lisa talks about recovery from the perspective that while the situation is intense now, it will likely diminish over time. She suggests helping the daughter focus on other aspects of her life and building her identity beyond the incident.
Preventative Measures:
For prevention, Lisa emphasizes the importance of conversations about the implications of sending nudes and how to handle requests for them. She advocates for clear family guidelines about not requesting or sending such images.
Empowerment and Self-defense:
Empowering the daughter to stand up for herself if criticized and to redirect any negative attention towards the boy who shared the photo is considered crucial. Lisa suggests framing responses for the daughter to use that assert her dignity and shift scrutiny appropriately.

ADDICTION,How can I help students to overcome social media addiction?,AAP,"To best address this question, it might be helpful to first talk about “problematic technology use”.  One way to think about this term is using technology in ways that may have social and physical impacts; for example, prioritizing technology use so much that an adolescent doesn’t interact with friends or family offline, or being on their phone so late into the evening that a teen falls asleep in class.  

While “addiction” terminology is sometimes used to describe problematic technology use and often dominates the headlines around social media, studies have actually shown that it’s not an accurate way to describe teens’ experiences with social media. Research finds instead that when young people experience problematic use of social media, it’s more of a broad range of challenges they experience; addictive behaviors are only at the extreme end of that spectrum.   

It’s also important to recognize that it’s not something wrong with the teen using the platform causing them to feel this way; many interactive technologies are specifically designed to capture and hold a user’s interest. It can be hard for children and teens to overcome those design features. Using language of ‘addiction’ can make it sound like the problem is with the child user, whereas for many children, with support they can learn strategies to overcome that tech design. 

Preventing problematic technology use involves three approaches: balance, boundaries and communication: 

Balance: Figuring out the right balance between online and offline time is an important topic of discussions for families. There is no evidence for a universal screen time limit that applies to every child. However, families can discuss which approaches might be appropriate to ensure children get adequate sleep, daily physical activity, time for play and reading and discovery, time with people they care about and time to focus on learning without multitasking.  
Boundaries: Boundaries refers to setting limits around what youth are willing to display about themselves online or on social media, as well as setting limits on where youth spend their time online or when using tech. Discussing guidelines on what types of personal information are not appropriate to post on social media sites with children and teens can help prevent them from several online safety risks. These risks include being targets of bullying, unwanted solicitation or embarrassment. It is also important to talk about spaces to avoid, and what to do if unwanted or inappropriate information comes up when a child is online. 
Communication: Just as with other core areas of child health, parents and other trusted adults should discuss social media and technology with youth early and often. It is okay to not know the ins and outs of each platform a child uses; an adult’s role is to create a space where the child feels comfortable discussing their concerns and experiences using technology. For parents, establishing home rules for social media and technology use as soon as a child begins using these tools is an important way to promote healthy technology use from the start.  
One approach to share with parents for prevention and intervention to promote healthy technology use is the Family Media Use Plan. The Family Media Plan includes options for rules and guidance around balance and boundaries and can be a tool to promote positive communication.

ADDICTION,"I recently heard about social media addiction, what is that? Do I need to worry about that for my 13-year-old who just started using Snapchat? Is this different than video game addiction?",AAP,"To best address this question, it might be helpful to first talk about what we mean by “problematic technology use”. One way to think about this term is using technology in ways that may have social and physical impacts; for example, prioritizing technology use so much that an adolescent doesn’t interact with friends or family offline, or being on their phone so late into the evening that a teen falls asleep in class.

Having open communication with your child about how they feel and how easy (or challenging) it is to log off can help parents identify ways to provide that support and learning. Our previous response also offers ways to help prevent problematic technology use. 

Another myth is that problematic technology use is all about the amount of time spent using technology, or screen time. One teen may use technology one hour a day and it is clearly problematic, and another child may use technology 2.5 hours a day and they are learning and thriving. In general, the amount of screen time itself is not an adequate way to represent problematic technology use. 

The good news is even if your teen uses different modes of technology like gaming or social media platforms, the ways to help them cope are really similar.  

How to Identify Potentially Problematic Technology Use 
Look for changes in behavior: physically, emotionally, socially and functionally. Such as: 
avoiding offline social connect to be online,  
lower grades due to overuse of technology, or  
being emotionally withdrawn due to negative social experiences on technology.  
Seek the advice of your child’s pediatrician regarding any concerns you might have. 
Consider looking at a validated screening tool for problematic internet use, the Problematic and Risky Internet Use Screening scale (PRIUSS) is used in many physician’s offices and you can use it at home.  
One strength of this scale is that you can see the areas in which your child is struggling and tailor solutions that focus specifically on those issue areas.

ADDICTION,My Kid Seems Addicted to Their Phone. What Do I Do?,Common Sense,"It may seem like your kid is addicted (and may even ""feel"" addicted) to the phone, but it's more likely normal teen behavior. Teens check their devices frequently and feel pressure to respond quickly to messages. And their friends tend to take priority over everything else.

In fact, doctors don't agree whether people can become addicted to technology. And if technology addiction exists, it's very rare. Hopefully, you're only dealing with a compulsive habit that you can manage by structuring your kid's time. Schedule time for the phone to be off, schedule activities during which the phone can't be used, and look into programs that block the phone from being used. If you suspect the problem is true addiction, talk to your child's doctor.

Consider how much time you spend looking at your phone, too. Make sure you're setting a good example at home by moderating your own tech use. And it's always a good idea to invite your child to do something together that doesn't involve screens. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/my-kid-seems-addicted-to-their-phone-what-do-i-do",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/my-kid-seems-addicted-to-their-phone-what-do-i-do
ADDICTION,Could My Child Be Addicted to Video Games?,Common Sense,"The word ""addiction"" gets used a lot to describe a certain kind of focused attention on screens and tech. We say we're ""addicted"" to our phones or ""addicted"" to watching our favorite show. But research shows that 8- to 18-year-olds also use video games and other forms of tech to stay connected with family and friends.

If you have concerns about your child's behavior, you may want to talk with a pediatrician. They can look into what might be causing problems, whether it's game addiction or another issue, like depression. Try to pay attention to whether gaming affects your child's mood, grades, or how they interact with others.

Also consider how much time you spend looking at screens. Make sure you're setting a good example at home. Try to model how long to use devices and when to put them away. And it's always a good idea to encourage your child to do something offline. This includes exercising, spending time outside, and socializing with others. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/could-my-child-be-addicted-to-video-games",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/could-my-child-be-addicted-to-video-games
ADDICTION,What's the difference between technology addiction and problematic use?,Common Sense,"Technology addiction and problematic use might look similar, but they are different. For one thing, currently doctors don't agree on a single definition of technology addiction. Also, when people are addicted, their brains and bodies won't let them stop using or engaging in something even when it hurts them. Problematic media use may cause difficulties, but limits can help.

Many kids use their phones or computers all the time. They mostly use technology to connect with friends, which is important to tweens and teens. But it can become problematic when it gets in the way of other important activities, such as school and family time.

If kids are having problems keeping up with schoolwork, chores, and activities, help them get back on track with some limits. If kids truly cannot control themselves -- they sneak their phones, feel bad about their behavior, lose friends, or stop other activities including schoolwork -- they may be showing signs similar to addiction. In either case, establishing and reinforcing a balanced approach to media may help.

ADDICTION,How can I make sure my kid doesn't get addicted to technology?,Common Sense,"It's unlikely that your kid will become addicted to technology. A person with an addiction can't stop doing something that is extremely harmful, despite severe negative consequences. But you're right to be concerned. According to a Common Sense Media poll, 50 percent of teens say they ""feel"" addicted to their mobile devices, and 59 percent of parents ""feel"" their kids are addicted to them. Still, experts aren't sure whether true, physical technology addiction exists (although the American Psychiatric Association has identified ""Internet gaming disorder"" as ""a condition of interest""). And if it does, it's very rare. More likely, your kid may have problems balancing technology with other parts of their life.

Problematic technology use is a growing concern. You can help avoid it by showing your kids how you want them to use technology. Let them see your own healthy habits. Set rules for how much technology they can use during the week. Share what's important to you.

These ideas can help your family figure out how media and technology can be a part of your family's healthy lifestyle.

Create media free-zones and times. These will be different for every family, but you can consider making phones off-limits at the dinner table, before bed, and in the car, when important conversations can happen.

Limit multitasking. Multitasking makes it harder to focus on one thing and can be harmful to face-to-face conversations.

Do family activities. Take time for tech-free activities. A simple walk around the block or a game of hangman can bring you closer together.

Co-view and discuss. When you can, try to watch shows or play games with your kid. Kids whose parents take part in their media lives make better choices and spend less time with media.

Talk about the pressure to respond. Nearly three-quarters of teens feel pressure to respond to their mobile devices quickly. While friends and online socializing are super important to teens, not every text is critical. Discuss how they could break the habit, perhaps by responding once an hour to all messages instead of constantly being at the ready. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-i-make-sure-my-kid-doesnt-get-addicted-to-technology",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-i-make-sure-my-kid-doesnt-get-addicted-to-technology
YOUTUBE,What are YouTube unboxing videos?,Common Sense,"Unboxing videos are exactly what they sound like: People opening boxes and narrating their actions. Unboxing videos are very popular with kids, racking up millions of views and tens of millions of subscribers. Some unboxing videos, such as ones about toys and Kinder Surprise eggs are usually fine for kids to watch (with a few caveats). But the subject matter of some unboxing videos are not age-appropriate. If your kid likes these videos, be aware that they are not technically ""reviews"" of a product's pros and cons. Unboxing videos show the product in a favorable light and can have the same effect as advertising. Learn a little bit more about them and how to manage kids' fascination below.

Who is behind unboxing videos? All kinds of people -- including kids -- do unboxing videos. Kid hosts, such as the child star of Ryan Toys Review, often fall into it accidentally when their parents upload videos of them that become popular. Some YouTube channels that focus on unboxing don't even have an on-camera host. FunToys Collector Disney Toys Review is just a woman's hands opening toys and playing with them. Folks who specialize in unboxing are usually regular people, with no relationship to the companies whose products they feature.

What are the products in unboxing videos? Unboxing videos for kids typically focus on toys and candy, including Kinder Surprise eggs, Transformers, American Girl Dolls, and Legos.

Are unboxers paid by the companies whose products they open on YouTube? Companies don't usually pay the YouTuber directly for featuring their product in a video. When an unboxer becomes super popular (with tens of millions of views and subscribers), companies may send them products for free, but not always. Sometimes hosts disclose this, sometimes not. Companies do sponsor the extremely popular and influential YouTubers in other areas. For example, they may pay the YouTuber to make a personal appearance at a toy store or a toy convention.

What do I do if my kid wants all the stuff they see in unboxing videos? Unboxers are good at building excitement, choosing popular products, and showing off an item's cool features. Sometimes companies send them toys even before they go on sale to fuel demand before the product's release. And if the unboxer is a kid, your kid may relate to them more and want what they have. You may want to set expectations before a viewing session. Or you could have your kid add the product to their birthday or holiday wish list -- and prune when the time comes. If your kid likes unboxing videos, it's a good opportunity to balance that with developing their sense of gratitude by reading these books and watching these movies and TV shows.

How can I find ""good"" unboxing sites? There are tons of unboxing videos on YouTube. But the subscriber tally and the video views are not always good indicators of quality. Always read a channel's About section to get a sense of the creators behind the videos. When you find a channel you like, subscribe to it. That tells YouTube you want to see more like it. Here are some unboxing videos that we like.
https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-are-youtube-unboxing-videos",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-are-youtube-unboxing-videos
YOUTUBE,"My kids love YouTube, especially watching unboxing videos and toy reviews. But sometimes it seems like it’s full of marketing. Is this OK?",AAP,"YouTube is a place where kids spend a lot of time, and marketers know this. They also know that kids mostly spend their own money on snacks/treats, beverages, toys and fast food. Therefore, they place branded food and beverage items – such as candy, fast food or soda – in YouTube videos, which reach billions of child viewers. Experiments have shown that only a small portion of preschoolers understood that the purpose of the ads they saw were to “sell you something”. Even if videos contain a “disclosure” that the material contains advertising, this doesn’t appear to change kids’ behavior. Additionally, when children see unhealthy foods in YouTube videos, they tend to prefer and eat more of those unhealthy foods, which could potentially affect their health and obesity risk.

What Parents Can Do
If your child loves YouTube, find content creators and YouTubers who are good role models, really try to tell a good story or teach something, rather than just showing excessive amounts of branded toys and foods. Viewing excessive marketing can make your child think of these purchases or foods as normal, everyday options, might make them beg for those unhealthy foods or overstuffed toy chests (marketers hope so!), or make it harder for you to establish healthy food preferences.
When you see an ad, see if your child can identify it and what the ad is trying to sell them. Help them understand that ads are created to persuade people to do things and buy things.
Try switching to platforms that have no ads or fewer ads, or at least YouTube channels with less marketing. For free video-playing apps with better-quality content, try switching to PBS KIDS Videos, Sensical or Noggin. You can see whether your child behaves any differently!

YOUTUBE,"As a parent of young children, what do I need to know about YouTube? 
 ",AAP,"YouTube is a free video sharing website, and YouTube Kids is a version designed to have only videos intentionally made for children.  On average, there are 100 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, so there’s an endless number of options. Videos include a wide variety of content from adorable cats, food recipes, science lessons, fashion tips, video games and much more.  

When children are on the main YouTube website or app, they are at risk of seeing inappropriate content. This is because they can search any term they want and the recommendation algorithm might recommend inappropriate videos, not knowing that they are a child. YouTube offers a supervised experience which is a parent-managed version of the regular YouTube experience for children. Parents can pair their YouTube/Google account to the child’s and select a content setting that limits what the child can watch.  Another options parents frequently use is creating a playlist of videos they want their child to watch, to avoid the child clicking on new recommended videos.  

If you do not feel comfortable having your child on YouTube, there is also YouTube Kids. YouTube Kids is a dedicated app with videos that are diverse but has a smaller selection of videos than what is available on the main YouTube app. It gives children a more contained environment and makes it easier to explore, but it still has a lot of “kid-influencer” videos that have been criticized for showing off too much, being rude or showing unhealthy food. 

If your child watches YouTube or YouTube Kids, be choosy about what videos and channels they watch. There are seemingly endless channels competing for your child’s attention, but many are not high-quality. Every family prefers different videos, but try to find channels where:  

The characters/YouTubers are positive and kind.  
They are not trying to sell your child anything or pressuring them to keep watching.  
There are not too many ads that block the screen or interrupt the video.  
You like watching along with your child (this is a good sign that the storyline is interesting or funny!).  
 Skip any kid-influencers who are showing off or being negative role models.

YOUTUBE,Why does my teen like to watch people play games on YouTube?,Common Sense,"""At any one time, there are thousands of gamers broadcasting themselves playing games on the main YouTube channel as well as on YouTube Gaming. Gamers can live-stream themselves narrating their way through games, post videos of Let's Plays (recordings of them playing games), and much, much more. It may not make much sense to parents, but live-streaming and Let's Plays attract serious fans. Enthusiasts gather to watch, chat, pick up tips, and enjoy the game -- not unlike other spectator sports.

Even though it seems like a solitary activity, watching others play the games you love is a form of social interaction. The top players are celebrities in the gaming world, and they draw huge audiences. But while YouTube has age-appropriate games such as Minecraft and Mario Kart, it features tons of violent video games, including Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, and more. And it's not just the games themselves that can be mature. The broadcasters and comments are totally unfiltered and frequently littered with hate speech, homophobia, sexism, and other derogatory talk. YouTube's Restricted Mode setting will block some of the edgy stuff, but not all.

If your teen likes to watch gamers on YouTube, it may be hard to restrict. You can try these tips for limiting YouTube content [[link to Q above]]. While lots of YouTube gamers are perfectly fine for kids, it's a good idea to check in and see who and what they're watching. You also want to help your kid manage their viewing time, as these videos can run upward of 30 minutes. Check the game reviews on Common Sense Media to find conversation-starter ideas for the games your teen likes. Here are some ideas to connect with teens over their interest in YouTube gamers.

Ask who their favorite players are and why. You might be surprised that your teen likes certain gamers because of the worldly wisdom they impart while they're playing. Just showing an interest in your teen's world helps strengthen your bond and gives you an in for conversation.

Talk about the games. Video games can be incredibly complex. The gamers who play the titles your teen likes reveal new and unique aspects of games that your kid didn't know about -- and which they can use when they play. Help them identify these takeaways -- they might lead to other interests or topics of discussion.

Counter negative messages. The video-gaming world can be very aggressive. There's swearing, sexist and racist comments, and more. Don't let your teen get away with adopting these attitudes. Keep reinforcing messages such as the importance of treating all people with respect.

Steer them toward the good stuff. Even ultra-violent video games have less violent alternatives. If your kid is getting into games that you think are too mature, help them find more appropriate ones to play.

Talk about different kinds of games. Discuss the differences between educational games, other games, and videos. Why is one type more beneficial? How can kids tell the difference between a site with games that offer some learning potential and games that are meant for adults?

Discuss good sportsmanship. Users can watch live feeds on the site and comment on what they're seeing. What kinds of things should kids never say when interacting with others online? https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/why-does-my-teen-like-to-watch-people-play-games-on-youtube""",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/why-does-my-teen-like-to-watch-people-play-games-on-youtube
YOUTUBE,What are red-band trailers on YouTube?,Common Sense,"Red-band trailers are basically R-rated movie trailers. They're designed for mature audiences, and they contain more sex, violence, swear words, and emotionally charged scenes than the ""green band"" versions that are approved for all audiences. You can tell you're watching a red-band trailer because the MPAA warning appears in front of a red background. And if you're watching one, you're probably on YouTube. Red-band trailers are created for the web, not the theater.

Red-band trailers are, of course, advertising. All of the major movie studios have YouTube channels where they offer promotional material for their latest films, including celebrity interviews, behind-the-scenes footage, outtakes, and both the red- and green-band versions of trailers. Lots of YouTube creators upload red-band versions as well.

Red-band trailers are supposed to be behind an ""age gate"" -- meaning you have to confirm that you're 17 to watch it. But in practice, red-band trailers are freely accessible to anyone. You can try to cut down on your kids' exposure to red-band trailers by enabling YouTube's Restricted Mode and and other features. Since YouTube serves up content based on your viewing and search history, your kids may not encounter red-band trailers unless they go looking for them. If they do see them, check our movie reviews for ideas on how to discuss movies' more mature themes.",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-are-red-band-trailers-on-youtube
YOUTUBE,Is it safe for my kid to watch Minecraft videos on YouTube?,Common Sense,"Since Minecraft is a game that appeals to many ages -- and has infinite possibilities -- not all YouTube videos will be age-appropriate. The unique features of the game, including the ability for any player to create anything they want, can result in wide variations in quality, age-appropriateness, and relevance to your kid's specific interests and gaming ability. If your kid is just starting out, it's a good idea to sit with them and help them find quality videos that teach Minecraft basics. After they get some familiarity with the better Minecraft channels, you can loosen the reins. But check in, too, because a lot of Minecraft YouTubers also play more mature games (and even mature versions of Minecraft).

There are hundreds of channels devoted to Minecraft, including popular but edgy ones such as Yogscast and SkyDoesMinecraft, and it's hard to know which ones are good for kids. Although you could download an app such as Enderflix Kids, which curates only kid-friendly Minecraft videos, you know your little fanatic will be begging -- and searching YouTube -- for more. Our curated list of kid-friendly Minecraft videos on YouTube is an excellent starting point for young players.

On YouTube, even kid-friendly videos come with a few caveats. First, with many clocking in at 20 or 30 minutes, they can be a major time suck. Second, many have commercials that advertise products ranging from cars to cookies to vodka. Third, some videos contain salty language, so it's best to preview videos when possible. Learn more about the world of Minecraft and how to engage with your kid around the game. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-safe-for-my-kid-to-watch-minecraft-videos-on-youtube",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-safe-for-my-kid-to-watch-minecraft-videos-on-youtube
YOUTUBE,How kid-friendly is the YouTube Kids app?,Common Sense,"The YouTube Kids app is definitely more kid-friendly than YouTube itself, but you may not want to totally let your kids loose on it at first. While the company is using more human monitors to review and curate videos, the app is still technically a portal to the main YouTube service and age-inappropriate videos can make it through the app's algorithm. YouTube Kids also runs ads, which has drawn criticism from consumer watchdog groups.

On the plus side, the YouTube Kids app is pretty simple, which reduces risks for kids. It has no interactive features (such as the ability to chat or post videos from the app), so kids can't have contact with other people. And it offers a few useful parental controls: You can turn off search, which limits kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content; you can set a time limit for kids to play on the app; and you can block videos, which helps the app know what types of videos you prefer to see. To be fair, YouTube Kids explains that there's potential for age-inappropriate content to slip through. It also recommends parents actively manage search settings to lessen any risks.

The safest way to let your kids use YouTube Kids is to supervise, watch together, and encourage kids to tell you if they see something weird, so you can take care of it. You can also try these other online streaming video services for kids. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-kid-friendly-is-the-youtube-kids-app",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-kid-friendly-is-the-youtube-kids-app
YOUTUBE,What's the deal with disturbing YouTube videos that look like they're for kids but are strange and upsetting?,Common Sense,"Your kid has settled in to watch what looks like a nice Peppa Pig video. The title of the video looked age-appropriate and your kid instantly recognized the familiar characters. But after a few minutes of normal play, the story goes horribly wrong. The characters start cursing, bleeding violently, or engaging in other disturbing acts. What's up with these strange videos that look like they're for kids but definitely are not? And why does YouTube show them to you?

Weird videos using familiar kids' TV characters are a thing on YouTube. They belong to a category of video called YouTube Poop (YTP). YTP is a mashup of familiar characters, images, and stories that go off the rails. People create them using video-editing software that lets them splice in clips from real shows. Though these videos deceive and scare people, that's not necessarily the creators' intention. More likely, they're trying to impress other fans of YTP (yes, they exist), mock kids' entertainment, and provoke YouTube by exposing weaknesses in the way the company serves up video content. The very fact that you clicked on the video sends data to YouTube that you like the video and want to see more in the same vein.

YouTube's algorithm came under fire when there was a public outcry over these disturbing videos showing up in the YouTube Kids app. In response, Google tightened up the restrictions on the videos it funnels to the YouTube Kids app. It also started requiring creators to designate their videos ""for kids,"" so theoretically the weird ones intended for teens and older fans wouldn't display in your kid's feed. But while YouTube has some ways of verifying whether videos are really ""for kids,"" the designation is the discretion of the creator, who may be willing to risk Google's consequences (such as suspension from the platform) to trick people. Google wants YouTube to remain a platform where users can express their creativity, and even though these videos are disturbing, they don't always violate YouTube's terms of service.

To reduce the risk of your kids seeing these disturbing videos, there are a few things you can do. In addition to using only the YouTube Kids app, you can use Restricted Mode, and remember to flag inappropriate videos, so YouTube won't show them to you. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/whats-the-deal-with-disturbing-youtube-videos-that-look-like-theyre-for-kids-but-are-strange-and-upsetting",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/whats-the-deal-with-disturbing-youtube-videos-that-look-like-theyre-for-kids-but-are-strange-and-upsetting
YOUTUBE,Why is my kid obsessed with YouTube stars?,Common Sense,"Now that YouTube has overtaken TV for teens -- and is heading that way for younger kids -- its stars have become celebrities to young fans. Most of us parents don't tend to tune into YouTube just to hang out and watch whatever comes on -- which is one way kids find out about these folks. So we find it hard to understand why people who broadcast using a webcam and an internet connection have such a powerful hold over our kids. But it's smart to have some awareness of your kids' media idols, perhaps especially on YouTube. Why? YouTube celebs are even more influential than traditional celebrities in shaping trends, guiding pop culture, and impacting opinions.

While plenty of YouTubers experience accidental fame, the ones that gain mega-popularity (such as Jenna Marbles with 17 million subscribers) work pretty hard at it. Good YouTubers are savvy about video creation and editing, know how to respond to what their viewers want, and excel at self-promotion on all social media, such as Instagram and Snapchat. They're also fast. Hosts can upload videos quickly because they don't have the same kind of production overhead of TV. This speed allows them to comment on news, pop culture, current events, and even video themselves on vacation or at the dentist's office. You may not see the appeal, but kids are all about being in the moment. Finally, many offer some type of expertise that kids are interested in. The insider tips on decorating, makeup, and fashion offered by British lifestyle guru Zoella has earned her 12 million subscribers. (Her delicate features and beautiful blue eyes don't hurt either.)

But as compelling as some YouTubers are to your kids, plenty aren't age-appropriate. For example, the Swedish gamer PewDiePie was discovered to have created racists and anti-Semitic videos (which caused YouTube to cancel a reality show he was set to star in). A lot of YouTubers take advantage of the platform's freewheeling nature to swear and make sexist, homophobic, and other offensive remarks. Even wholesome-seeming hosts go blue once in a while.

Here's the tough part for parents: The rebellious nature of some YouTubers often makes kids like them more. YouTube's unscripted, anything-goes quality is super appealing to kids. Maybe kids need a break from the world of school, rules, and chores. Maybe they're looking for others who validate their own thoughts and feelings, and these hosts can serve that purpose.

And while there are YouTube rebels, such as Jake Paul who pulls pranks and conducts general mayhem, there are also hosts who may use swear words or other negative imagery to express authentic feelings and emotions. The difference is important because at first glance you might lump them all together. Kids become attached to YouTube hosts in part because of their honesty and relatability. There's an intimacy that some YouTube hosts develop with their followers that isn't available on traditional media such as TV.

It's completely age-appropriate for kids to become devoted to certain media figures. But you want to help your kids find positive role models and other folks who use their platform for good. Being aware that, to your kids, these YouTubers have something meaningful to offer -- even if you don't particularly care for them -- is step one. Stay involved by watching together when you can. Ask questions about the hosts your kids like, what subjects they cover, and most important, what these topics mean to your kids. You may need to hold your nose or bite your tongue, but having an open mind will go a long way in your relationship with your kid. Plus, you can inject your own messages into the conversation to get your ideas across. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/why-is-my-kid-obsessed-with-youtube-stars

YOUTUBE,How do I set parental controls in the YouTube Kids app?,Common Sense,"YouTube Kids offers a few basic parental controls to limit kids' exposure to age-inappropriate content. The management features are in the parent settings section of the app, which is accessible from any screen and is passcode protected. Learn more about the YouTube Kids app and get an overview of the parental controls in the YouTube Kids app below.

Kid profiles. YouTube Kids lets you create unique profiles for each of your kids. Adding your kid's age to their profile helps YouTube Kids show videos that are most appropriate to them.

Search. For each user profile, you can choose whether to allow the ability to search the app or not (so you can allow your 8-year-old to search but not your 4-year-old, for example). Turning off the ability to search limits videos to only the ones that have been verified as age-appropriate by people on the YouTube Kids team.

Custom passcodes. The parent settings are passcode protected. You can create a custom passcode that only you know, which is a good idea. Otherwise, you'll get a randomly generated passcode every time you want to log in. The randomly generated one is spelled out, but if your kids can read they can get in.

Collections. For each kid profile, you can select curated channels on a variety of subjects provided by YouTube's content partners such as PBS Kids and Sesame Workshop.

Block videos. You can block any video you don't want your kids to see (and YouTube will use this information to prevent similar videos from being shown).

Timer. You can set a timer for up to one hour, so kids have to stop when their time is up. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-set-parental-controls-in-the-youtube-kids-app",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-set-parental-controls-in-the-youtube-kids-app
YOUTUBE,What do I need to know about YouTube?,Common Sense,"You've heard of YouTube rabbit holes, right? That's when you go on YouTube to watch a Saturday Night Live clip and emerge later to find that your kid is married with three kids. And if you can't resist YouTube's siren call, our latest research confirms that kids are powerless against it. In fact, kids would rather watch online videos than do almost anything else—which is a teensy bit scary considering YouTube celebs have more influence on kids than movie stars. But, trust us: We've been down a few rabbit holes ourselves. We'll point you toward the good stuff, teach you how to use YouTube's settings and features, explain what influencers, unboxing videos, and challenges mean to your kid, and help your family get the best out of this complex entertainment and educational platform.

Quick Take
YouTube is an important way kids learn about the world. It's a one-stop shop for information about everything kids want to know about. It's also a big source of news, which for kids includes internet culture, memes, and online trends.
YouTube is really influential. Kids can learn anything from algebra to the latest dance craze. But they can also pick up misinformation, extreme viewpoints, age-inappropriate concepts, and risky ideas (see: the Tide Pod Challenge).
You can't control YouTube, but you can manage it (and you should). YouTube offers a few features, including subscriptions, the ability to disable autoplay, and Restricted Mode, that can help you reduce your kid's exposure to mature content.
What does the research say about YouTube—and what does it mean for my family?
YouTube embodies the open-web philosophy of its game-changing parent company, Google, which is all about providing a platform for whatever anybody wants to create and share. That's cool and all, but the anything-goes concept, combined with content selected by algorithm vs. human beings, means your kid will definitely come into contact with inappropriate videos. Recent research sheds some light on where kids are going on YouTube and what they love about it. Here are four key findings, plus our takeaways to help manage kids' experience.

It's where a lot of kids get their news. Our research report, News and America's Kids: How Young People Perceive and Are Impacted by the News, found that for kids who go to social media for current events, 41% of tweens and 47% of teens like YouTube the best.
Takeaway: On one hand, it's great that kids want to be informed; on the other, YouTube isn't the most accurate source for news.
Kids love it. According to our latest census, watching online videos is now tweens' favorite media activity. (Four years ago, it ranked fifth in enjoyment.) Today, the percent of 8- to 12-year-olds who say they watch online videos every day is more than double what it was in 2015.
Takeaway: You can't underestimate the role of YouTube's algorithm, which is optimized to hold users' attention for as long as possible.
Inappropriate content is common. A 2018 YouTube study by the Pew Research Center found that 61% of parents who let their kids 11 and younger watch YouTube have encountered inappropriate content.
Takeaway: Keep an eye on what kids are watching and steer them toward the good stuff.
It has a big impact on kids. Feeling in the know and being a part of a community is a powerful combination for kids. It's these feelings that stir kids' support of YouTubers like PewDiePie (the Swedish gamer whose anti-Semitic rants netted him even more followers) more than famous Hollywood stars.
Takeaway: When you talk to your kid about YouTube, you'll get further if you acknowledge its value in your kid's life.
Is it possible to find good stuff—and keep my kid from straying—on YouTube?
Big yes to the first question. Thumbs way down on the second. Although kids find out about new channels and YouTubers from friends, the algorithm that recommends videos related to the main video is a key way kids navigate the platform and discover new content. But these videos can be problematic. While related videos are connected to the original, they may be longer, more mature, or otherwise inappropriate. (You can thank YouTube's business model for that: The longer users watch, the more YouTube makes in ad sales.) To limit these risks, log in to your account and:

Disable autoplay. Either in the app or on your browser, go to the Up Next section and toggle off Autoplay. In this mode, nothing plays until you make a new selection.

Manage the History. Go to History in the Library section. You can turn off and clear the Watch history and Search history. This erases all the previous data Google was tracking to identify related videos and lets your kid start fresh. You can also delete individual videos from the History when you don't want Google to use them  for related videos.

Use Restricted Mode. Click or tap on your profile pic to get to your account settings. In the browser version, Restricted Mode appears at the bottom of the drop-down menu. In the app, tap Settings to get to the screen where you can toggle it on. Restricted Mode cuts down on inappropriate videos but won't eliminate them completely.

Subscribe to specific channels. When you subscribe, you'll see these channels in the feed, and it also helps YouTube's algorithm decide what else to show.

Don't use YouTube. Believe it or not, YouTube isn't the only place for kids to watch cool videos. Try one of the YouTube alternatives from the list below.

Are there any parental controls on YouTube?
YouTube is technically for teens 13 and up, so the controls it offers are geared for users to set for themselves, not for parents to set for kids. On the YouTube app, you'll find settings that remind you to take a break, restrict your viewing time, and stop notifications. If you want parental controls that you can lock down, you have to use the YouTube Kids app, which lets you set time limits, turn off search, and curate your kid's feed.

In January 2020, YouTube made some changes to the platform in response to its violations of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The changes require creators to designate whether their content is for kids, which should help the algorithm serve up more kid-friendly videos in the Up Next section. The changes also mean that you can no longer add kids' videos to a playlist or make comments on them, which distinguishes them from content meant for viewers over 13. A big white space where the comments used to be sure makes kids' videos more age-appropriate. However, we liked the playlist feature for its ability to help parents curate content just for young viewers. YouTube's actions are probably the tip of the iceberg. As the Federal Trade Commission continues to crack down on online companies playing fast and loose with consumer privacy laws (especially those that protect kids), and as more platforms come into compliance with stricter rules, such as those being enacted in California, you'll probably see more platforms disable or change features.

Remember, your device offers some ways to limit time on YouTube and other apps. On iPhones, go to Settings/Screen Time/App Limits/Add Limit; find the YouTube app and set a daily amount. On Android phones, use the Family Link app to set your kid's daily viewing allowance. Both operating systems also offer some content-restriction tools, which may not work perfectly but are a good idea.

What's the best way to keep tabs on my kids' YouTube-watching?
You can check their Search history and Watch history, but they'll probably open up more if you simply ask. YouTube has such a huge range of content, and there's lots of questionable stuff, but most kids are just looking to laugh or learn something. If you're lucky and your kid wants to tell you about their favorite videos, introduce you to YouTube personalities they like, or show you some cool channels they've found, just be prepared for anything. What kids like to watch on YouTube can be highly specific to their tastes—and not yours.

Then again, because YouTube is an important way kids learn about the world, many use it to search for and view videos of things they're curious about—and they may not be ready to share with their parents. This is developmentally appropriate, but you do want to make sure that your kid isn't watching inappropriate content or learning inaccurate information. It's tricky, but if kids don't want to share with you, get the names of the channels they're watching and look at them later. Watch a few videos by the same creator to get a feel for the content. Here are some ideas to get your kid to open up about what they're watching:

Ask who their favorite YouTubers are and why. You might be surprised that your kid likes certain folks, like Emma Chamberlain, as much for their humor as their intelligence.

If your kid's a gamer, ask who they like to watch play. Though watching people play video games on YouTube may seem weird, for some kids it's like any spectator sport. The gamers who play the titles your kid likes reveal new and unique aspects of games that your kid didn't know about—and that they can use when they play.

Counter negative messages. Whether it's in the comments, the subject matter of a video, or ideas expressed by YouTubers, kids will likely encounter swearing, sexist and racist comments, and more. Keep reinforcing messages such as the importance of treating all people with respect. If your kid seems influenced by extreme viewpoints—and it seems more than a phase—it's worth exploring with them in a curious and nonjudgmental way.

Steer them toward the good stuff. If your kid is getting into stuff you think is too mature, help them find more appropriate videos to watch. Read our YouTube channel reviews and check our ""Best of"" lists for ideas.

Share your faves. Show them videos you like—for example, music from your high school years, TV shows you watched growing up, and historic events that have significance. Watching your videos may loosen up your kid to share more of theirs.

One more thing!
Many kids go through a phase of imitating YouTube. Even preschool-age kids will pretend they're hosting their own videos. It's normal. Ask them to put on a show for you. Now, if your kid wants to create their own YouTube channel for real, you can try to help your kid do it as safely as possible. Also on that page: alternatives to YouTube (good luck with that, though…).

YOUTUBE,Should I be concerned about the ads my kid sees on YouTube?,Common Sense,"Is there anything more annoying than those ads that appear all over the videos your kids watch on YouTube? Typically, an ad plays before the video, then more pop up all over the clip itself. You find yourself clicking them away instead of enjoying the show. And the ads are usually for age-inappropriate stuff, such as cars, web services, mature movies, and junk food. Most annoying, it seems that there's no end to the types of ads that can fit into a tiny video. Should you be concerned that your kids see these ads on YouTube?

Research on the negative impact of commercial content on kids has mostly focused on TV and movie advertising. But some small, early studies of the effect of digital marketing on kids shows a clear impact on everything from their understanding of money to exposure to alcohol ads to their privacy. Plus, ""targeted"" ads -- the ones that are based on a user's data trail and that YouTube aims to display -- are more influential than general ones. And kids under 7 don't understand that ads are trying to sell them something -- which is why commercials are regulated on TV.

A lot of folks are complaining that YouTube ads are out of control. In addition to the ones that play before the video, called bumpers, there are skippable ads, nonskippable ads, sponsorships, banners, and annotations that all appear at random while the video plays. The thing is, while YouTube controls some ads on videos, it's actually the clip's creator who controls the type and number of ads you see on individual videos. Creators make money off those ads -- and some say the more the merrier. Tons of ads is actually one sign of poor quality. You can't turn off ads on YouTube, but you can manage how much commercial content your kids are exposed to. Try these tips:

Personalize your ads. YouTube tries to tailor its ads to users' interests, activities, age, and other factors, and it would rather show you ads for stuff you'd like to see since they're more effective. In your Google Account settings, under Personal Info & Privacy, click on Ads Settings. Then click on Manage Ads Settings. Here you can ""personalize"" ads by telling Google what topics you don't want to see and what topics you like. Over time, your ads across all Google properties, including search, should be more to your liking. This has privacy implications, but at least you can avoid a lot of age-inappropriate ads.

Subscribe to YouTube Premium. Similar to other online video streaming services such as Hulu, YouTube Premium offers ad-free videos on the main site and YouTube Kids for a monthly fee. It will still show some ads, but not the annoying, invasive ones.

Stick to well-known, quality creators. YouTube gives its creators a monetary incentive to show personalized ads. But creators can disable this option. Higher-quality creators, including known brands such as Sesame Street, show fewer ads. (Look for the check mark next to a creator's name to make sure it is the brand you think it is.)

Use YouTube Kids. The advertising in the YouTube Kids app is limited. Google says the ads that run on YouTube Kids are approved as family-friendly and don't contain click-throughs to other sites. But consumer watchdog organizations have objected to the app running ads at all. And some of the content on YouTube kids -- like the popular unboxing videos -- are really ads themselves.

Consider an ad blocker. These downloadable browser add-ons will block some but not all advertising. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-be-concerned-about-the-ads-my-kid-sees-on-youtube",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-be-concerned-about-the-ads-my-kid-sees-on-youtube
YOUTUBE,Why does my teen like to watch people play games on YouTube?,Common Sense,"""At any one time, there are thousands of gamers broadcasting themselves playing games on the main YouTube channel as well as on YouTube Gaming. Gamers can live-stream themselves narrating their way through games, post videos of Let's Plays (recordings of them playing games), and much, much more.

Enthusiasts gather to watch, chat, pick up tips, and enjoy the game -- not unlike other spectator sports.

Even though it seems like a solitary activity, watching others play the games you love is a form of social interaction. The top players are celebrities in the gaming world, and they draw huge audiences. But while YouTube has age-appropriate games such as Minecraft and Mario Kart, it features tons of violent video games, including Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, and more. And it's not just the games themselves that can be mature. The broadcasters and comments are totally unfiltered and frequently littered with hate speech, homophobia, sexism, and other derogatory talk. YouTube's Restricted Mode setting will block some of the edgy stuff, but not all.

If your teen likes to watch gamers on YouTube, it may be hard to restrict. You can try these tips for limiting YouTube content [[link to Q above]]. While lots of YouTube gamers are perfectly fine for kids, it's a good idea to check in and see who and what they're watching. You also want to help your kid manage their viewing time, as these videos can run upward of 30 minutes. Check the game reviews on Common Sense Media to find conversation-starter ideas for the games your teen likes. Here are some ideas to connect with teens over their interest in YouTube gamers.

Ask who their favorite players are and why. You might be surprised that your teen likes certain gamers because of the worldly wisdom they impart while they're playing. Just showing an interest in your teen's world helps strengthen your bond and gives you an in for conversation.

Talk about the games. Video games can be incredibly complex. The gamers who play the titles your teen likes reveal new and unique aspects of games that your kid didn't know about -- and which they can use when they play. Help them identify these takeaways -- they might lead to other interests or topics of discussion.

Counter negative messages. The video-gaming world can be very aggressive. There's swearing, sexist and racist comments, and more. Don't let your teen get away with adopting these attitudes. Keep reinforcing messages such as the importance of treating all people with respect.

Steer them toward the good stuff. Even ultra-violent video games have less violent alternatives. If your kid is getting into games that you think are too mature, help them find more appropriate ones to play.

Talk about different kinds of games. Discuss the differences between educational games, other games, and videos. Why is one type more beneficial? How can kids tell the difference between a site with games that offer some learning potential and games that are meant for adults?

Discuss good sportsmanship. Users can watch live feeds on the site and comment on what they're seeing. What kinds of things should kids never say when interacting with others online? https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/why-does-my-teen-like-to-watch-people-play-games-on-youtube""",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/why-does-my-teen-like-to-watch-people-play-games-on-youtube
BODY IMAGE,"So many images girls (and boys) see on social, or in selfies they share, are manipulated to make them look more ""perfect"", with digital altering that can change the body, put (more) makeup on and change the face, etc. While this perpetuates unrealistic beauty standards, girls seem to enjoy looking at and creating these images. What can parents and educators do, if anything, to change this?",AAP,"Answer: During adolescence, it is common for teens of all genders to have increased concerns about body image and appearance. Taking and posting selfies in and of itself is not necessarily an unhealthy behavior. The thoughts that can accompany posting selfies, however, like feeling you are being dishonest or fake, and behaviors like using filters and editing to maximize physical attractiveness, and seeking feedback from others, can lead to negative self-image and poorer well-being. Looking at online images of close friends, distant peers or celebrities and comparing oneself to these images can create feelings of body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. Additionally, parents’ own beauty ideals and social media behavior often model and impact adolescents’ behaviors.

What Parents Can Do:
Take an active approach to your child’s social media use, interact with social media content together and have conversations around the content.
Example comment: “I heard about this trend in photos, can you show me what you are seeing on Instagram?”
Be supportive of your adolescent’s identity and body by using positive messages and have discussions about what's real and not real online.
Example comment: “Looking at this picture on Instagram, how do you feel when you see it? I can share a little about what I feel but would like to know your thoughts.”
Be thoughtful about the way you talk about your own appearance within photos and how you react to others’ appearance in photos, emphasizing what our bodies allow us to do rather than how they look.
Example comment: “Look at this picture of us after we did that long walk in the park, we look so happy and strong!”
Encourage social media activities that promote identity exploration, building and maintaining friendships, and expressing oneself in creative ways.
Example comment: “I love seeing all the ways you show different parts of your identity on your platform!”   https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/adolescents/early-adolescence-questions/viewing-and-creating-curated-images/",https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/adolescents/early-adolescence-questions/viewing-and-creating-curated-images/
BODY IMAGE,How do I protect my kid's body image?,Common Sense,"Let's dig into a very important topic: body image. You've probably already noticed the influence of YouTube, TV, and movies on the way your kid wants to dress, act, and even play. If your kid's on social media, you may see them measuring themselves against others or calculating their ""likes."" But despite being fed a steady diet of idealized images, kids also get a lot of their body-image messages from you. In fact, parents—especially moms—can make a huge difference in how both boys and girls feel about their bodies.

What do we know about how media affects kids?
While the impact of traditional media such as TV and magazines on body image is well documented, studies on the impact of digital media is still trickling in. Here's what our research—released in 2015—shows:

Television, movies, and traditional advertising can make kids feel bad about themselves. They contain unrealistic, idealized, sexualized, and stereotypical portrayals of body types—and kids sometimes want to emulate what they see.

Social media can trigger a negative thought cycle. The comparison that happens when kids judge themselves against others—especially friends they think are more attractive—can cause kids to spin out on self-loathing.

Digital media is a megaphone for unrealistic images. A magazine or TV show may have a few images of buff bods, but Pinterest and Instagram have millions. And kids can scroll through them any time of day or night—or all the time.

Images are getting even more ridiculous. Whether it's online, in the movies, on Netflix, or in ads, bodies are even more idealized than ever (skinny girls with big boobs or butts, and six-pack abs for guys).

We don't know enough about how media affects the self-image of certain populations. Young kids, boys, kids of color, and LGBTQ youth are all under-studied, so we don't have a good sense of how traditional or digital media impacts their self-image.

What am I up against?
Oh, basically our entire culture as a whole (no biggie!). But seriously, right now, our culture is extremely skewed toward outward appearance and external validation. In fact, doctors have identified a new phenomenon highlighting this hall-of-mirrors effect: Snapchat dysmorphia, where plastic surgery patients bring in pics edited with app filters, asking to look more like their photos. Even the most enlightened kid can be susceptible to body image messages they find online, including:

Unhealthy sites to obsess over the body. Fitspo (short for ""fit inspiration"") is a category of online content that purports to be about a healthy lifestyle, but mostly glorifies super-skinny or outrageously buff bodies. ""Pro-ana"" sites promote the disordered eating, skeletal aesthetic, and dangerous weight loss of anorexia.

Influencers hawking diet methods. The internet is full of celebs and social media influencers who are sponsored by diet product companies pushing risky weight loss methods like diet teas and even steroids. (In fact, Instagram recently said it would restrict posts promoting these too-good-to-be-true products.)

Online challenges. Every so often, image-oriented contests like the Kylie Jenner Lip Challenge go viral, with kids using dangerous methods like eyeliner glue and sucking air out of a shot glass to plump their lips.

With all this scary stuff out there, what can I do?
You're up against a lot, it's true. But studies prove that moms' messages about body appreciation go a long way toward influencing kids to accept themselves as they are and, importantly, counteracting all those other messages from media and culture. Dads of course have a lot of influence on kids' self-perception, too—it's just that research has focused on mothers.

And, though we have a long way to go, there are some flickers of change happening. Artists and entertainers such as Billie Eilish, Jameela Jamil, and Zendaya are using their platforms to advocate for positive body image. Beauty and clothing brands from Dove to H&M are pledging not to airbrush their photos. And models such as Ashley Graham, Winnie Harlowe, and Jillian Mercado are proving that skin color, size, and physical ability don't define beauty. Here's what you can do and say to help make sure your kid feels secure in their own skin and, by the way, begins to view every body as beautiful and valuable to society:

Hold off on social media as long as possible. Kids—especially younger ones—tend to imitate what they see on social media before they really understand what they're doing and what messages they're sending. Keeping those images at bay prolongs the amount of time kids have to develop their own sense of self.

Help kids view media critically. Together, analyze messages about attractiveness on TV, in ads, in games, and online. At the grocery store, point out photos that look too good to be true on the magazine covers.

Emphasize what your body can do, not what it looks like. Say, ""Your long legs help you run fast!""

Don't criticize your own body. Listen, we grew up in this culture, too, so it's hard not to reflect that. But work toward self-acceptance and remember that your kids pick up on even the littlest thing, like the defeated sigh when you can't button your jeans.

Stress internal strength vs. external validation. You can model this: Discuss how a ""like"" on your photo might give you a mood boost, but you feel even better when you do something nice for a friend.

Seek out nontraditional and diverse content. Try kids' shows from other countries available on streaming; they tend to have more natural-looking characters—i.e., moms who don't look like teenagers. Look for characters in books, on TV, and in movies who defy the Barbie aesthetic.

Look for positive, diverse role models. Reject the idea that there's only one standard of beauty. It's not wrong to want to look attractive, but encourage kids to find what they think looks great, not conform to an ideal.

You can do everything ""right,"" and …
A lot of parents take it hard when their kids remain stubbornly focused on appearance, despite all their best efforts to convince them looks don't matter. But it is developmentally appropriate for kids to be a little obsessed with how their bodies look. Also, some kids are just more sensitive to body image messages and anxious about their bodies. And some kids are more vulnerable at certain times of their lives, such as when they're physically developing, changing schools, or in the spotlight on a sports team or in a play. Just try to stay on message.

But if you sense your kid is overly concerned about body image to the point where they may be dieting, overexercising, compulsively looking at social media, taking unsafe supplements, or engaging in any other destructive behavior, you may have a more serious problem on your hands than typical adolescent insecurity. Be on the lookout for signs of distress (secretive behavior, changes in how they act, slipping grades, etc.), and make an appointment with your pediatrician, who can recommend a counselor if necessary. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-protect-my-kids-body-image",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-protect-my-kids-body-image
BODY IMAGE,How can media affect kids' body image?,Common Sense,"Media of all kinds, from TV to magazines and more, can impact body image, just as those closest to us, from our parents to our peers, also can.

When the media celebrates certain types of behaviors and appearances, it can leave a strong impression on kids, shaping their ideas of what will make them popular, attractive, and happy (or the opposite: unpopular, unattractive, and unhappy). How often are characters with larger body types, for example, portrayed in movies in romantic situations compared to thin characters? Kids may compare their own appearances to those of celebrities, models, animated TV characters, or toys -- body shapes that may be unrealistic or just plain unattainable. This kind of comparison can lead to body shame and low body esteem, which can lead to serious behaviors.

It's also important to remember that kids today not only are consumers of media but also are active creators. This presents both opportunities and pitfalls. On one hand, kids may grapple with how to present themselves online and manage their online appearances, or they may find themselves comparing the way they look to how their friends look, or they may get a boost of confidence from friends' reactions to their personal photos. On the other hand, kids may see friends, celebrities, and others who use online media to challenge harmful stereotypes about appearance ideals. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-media-affect-kids-body-image",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-media-affect-kids-body-image
BODY IMAGE,How is body image affected by social media and going online?,Common Sense,"The immediate public judgment and comparison social media provides can affect body image, especially for girls. In our report on body-image studies, Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image, Common Sense found that teens who are active online fret about how they're perceived.

Among the findings:

35 percent are worried about people tagging them in unattractive photos;
27 percent feel stressed about how they look when posting photos; and
22 percent felt bad about themselves if their photos were ignored.
For kids who are susceptible to body dissatisfaction, forums that promote the extremes of diet, weight loss, fitness, and even eating disorders can be a risk. So-called ""pro-ana"" sites encourage unrealistic thinness ideals and anorexia with photos, personal essays, and scary slogans such as ""starving is an example of excellent willpower."" Body-building groups can promote unhealthy regimens in the pursuit of lean or bulked-up musculature for boys.

But Common Sense also found some positive links between social media and body image. Some studies show that exposure to one's own social media photos can raise self-esteem. And social media has the potential to combat unrealistic appearance ideals. Kids are beginning to coopt social media and selfies to portray more realistic images, with pictures tagged as ""#nomakeup"" and ""#nofilter.""

Parents can play an important role in helping kids reject negative body-image messages from the online world.

Pay attention to what you say about your own body image, and make sure you emphasize what bodies can do versus what they look like.
Talk about eating healthily, exercising for physical fitness, and a healthy body image. Discourage extreme approaches to diet and exercise.
Encourage your kids to get involved in positive, constructive online forums where they feel valued.
Help your kid develop a healthy approach to social media so it's only one aspect of their lives.
If you're concerned that your kid is engaging in unhealthy activities, consider an appointment with your pediatrician. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-is-body-image-affected-by-social-media-and-going-online",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-is-body-image-affected-by-social-media-and-going-online
BODY IMAGE,"What is ""thinspiration,"" and what should I know about it?",Common Sense,"Pressure to live up to narrow beauty standards has contributed to a growing number of online communities dedicated to promoting unhealthy behavior. Thinspiration -- or ""thinspo"" -- websites feature photos, blog posts, diet and exercise instructions, and inspirational messages devoted to the pursuit of thinness. Also called ""pro ana"" (for pro-anorexia) sites, these communities draw kids who want to achieve the thin body ideal often praised in our culture. Clearly, they promote unhealthy ideals and activities, and kids should avoid them. It's not only teens who are affected; younger girls and boys are becoming more body-conscious, too.

Talk about the health consequences of eating disorders. Your kids may know of someone with anorexia or bulimia. Ask them about their reactions. Point out that these are illnesses, not defects, and that their friends need help. If your child has one of these disorders, it could be a life-threatening illness, and you should consult a medical professional immediately.

Don't bug kids about their weight -- emphasize health and fitness instead. Be an active family. Get your child up and moving by taking a walk, doing a sport, or taking a class at the gym together.

Set a good example. Don't speak critically about how you look when you're around your kids. Avoid saying that you've been ""bad"" for eating something or even calling certain foods ""good"" or ""bad."" Instead, model making healthy decisions and appreciating your body for all the wonderful things it can do.

Praise skills and talents. Make sure you're praising kids -- especially girls -- for the things they do, not their looks. Girls get a lot of attention for how they look, and it can make them focus more on their appearance than is healthy.

Watch out for signs of unhealthy eating. Fixating on appearance, dieting, and overeating all can be signs of a problem. Eating disorders are very serious and can even be life-threatening. The good news is that they're easier to treat the earlier they're caught, so make sure you know the signs, and don't be afraid to consult a medical professional if you're worried.

BODY IMAGE,At what age does media begin affecting my child's body image?,Common Sense media,"Body image is developed early in childhood, and even very young children can exhibit body dissatisfaction. Common Sense's report on body-image studies, Children, Teens, Media, and Body Image, found that more than half of girls and approximately one-third of boys age 6–8 indicate their ideal body weight is thinner than their current weight.

The study also found:

By age 6, children are aware of dieting and may have tried it;
26 percent of 5-year-olds recommend dieting as a solution for a person who has gained weight;
by the time kids reach age 7, one in four has engaged in some kind of dieting behavior; and,
between 1999 and 2006, hospitalizations for eating disorders among children below the age of 12 spiked 112 percent.
Although body image is influenced by many factors, media is one of several sources. Young children engage with some of the more extreme body portrayals in media in the form of dolls and action figures. And female characters in family films, on prime-time TV, and on kids' TV shows are nearly twice as likely to have an uncharacteristically small waist as their male counterparts.

You can help guide your kid away from negative body-image media messages by actively seeking out movies, games, TV shows, and music with positive messages around physical health, as well as positive role models for self-acceptance. A few other ideas:

Try to avoid stereotypical female and male characters in your kids' media. When you encounter them, discuss them with your kids and share your values.
Challenge assumptions around heavyset and slim characters. Help your kids think about how different characters are portrayed and whether they foster negative ideas about weight.
Point out characters, athletes, and celebrities who use their bodies to achieve something versus just trying to look good. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/at-what-age-does-media-begin-affecting-my-childs-body-image",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/at-what-age-does-media-begin-affecting-my-childs-body-image
ONLINE FRIENDS,Is it OK for my kid to friend her teacher on Facebook?,Common Sense,"Check with your school. Some have strict rules about teachers and students being Facebook friends on a teacher's personal page (and we've heard from many teachers who frown upon the practice.) But if the teacher creates a class-wide Facebook page or dedicated Facebook group, then he or she most likely is using it as a teaching tool. Still, you have the right to investigate further to make sure it's all legit.

Some educators are making use of social-learning networks such as Edmodo, Schoology, and Collaborize Classroom for their students to discuss issues and collaborate on projects or for teachers to assign and receive homework. Any teacher who requires students to join a social network should send home clear guidelines on how students should use it. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-ok-for-my-kid-to-friend-her-teacher-on-facebook",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-ok-for-my-kid-to-friend-her-teacher-on-facebook
ONLINE FRIENDS,Should I worry that I don't know who my kids' online friends are?,Common Sense,"Not necessarily. Kids' online friends are typically pals from school, sports, or other groups they're involved in. In fact, kids often strengthen their real-world friendships by connecting online. However, plenty of kids belong to certain online communities -- such as those related to Minecraft, LEGO, and the Hunger Games -- where they don't know the real identities of the other members. That may be fine, since online groups such as these often are bonded by a common purpose and don't bother engaging in negative behavior.

Certain precautions will help keep online relationships safer:

Make sure your kids set privacy settings that prevent people they don't know from contacting them.
Check in frequently with your kids about whom they're interacting with, whether they've ever been contacted by a stranger, and if they ever ""prune"" their contact lists by deleting or blocking acquaintances.
Make sure they know not to share personally identifiable information.
Ask about your kids' online relationships and what they're learning from their online interactions.
Talk about why they should never make plans to meet a stranger offline. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-worry-that-i-dont-know-who-my-kids-online-friends-are",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-worry-that-i-dont-know-who-my-kids-online-friends-are
SCREEN TIME,"How does a parent begin to set limitations on tech time where there are none? How does a parent deal with a spike in aggressive, tantrum behaviors due to new limitations?",AAP,"It’s never too late to set some boundaries around technology with the goal of having more time for family, sleep, or other activities.  

With so much technology out there competing for your family’s attention, if you don’t create any boundaries, it’s perfectly expected that screens would dominate your day! It’s not that you need to restrict screens because they’re “bad” – it’s more that you deserve to run your family the way you want to, and not have screens or tech get in the way. 

There’s no perfect way to do this! Our advice is based on a few different studies, particularly this one that asked parents and their children what they thought about different types of tech rules in their home. Interestingly, this study found that the biggest motivator for tech rules was the desire for all family members, regardless of age, to pay attention to one another when in one another's company. So, the need for tech boundaries apply to parents just as much as children. 

There’s an array of tips in the AAP’s Family Media Plan online tool, but we suggest starting with:  

Be proactive rather than reactive. Make a shared plan that you and your family agree to follow – starting with changes that you think are realistic – and checking back in weekly to see how it’s going. 
Keep rules for children and adults reasonably similar (e.g., no tech at the dinner table)– kids get frustrated when they think their parents are being hypocritical!  
Make small changes to start. This might include: 
Putting phones away while in the car, not checking at red lights, and instead talking about what you see out the windows. 
Putting phones and tablets away at dinner, maybe in a shoebox you decorate.  
Keep media use at predictable times of day, such as the morning or afternoons. Kids like predictable routines, and having an expectation that they only use screens at certain times of day makes it less likely they will beg or negotiate for screens throughout the day. If your child initially has resistance, give them choices about what time of day they want OR what show they want to watch/game they will play. It also helps to put the screen routine on a daily schedule or calendar, since some kids are visual learners.  
Keep in mind that parents and children think the easiest rules to follow are ones that:  

Are about the content that the child is allowed to access, 
The child had a part in designing in the first place (so they are more likely to think they are “fair”), or  
Parents enforce supportively rather than punitively.  
If your child shows aggressive or tantrum behaviors when a new limit is placed, you can interpret this as communication that they are frustrated (all behavior is communication, after all). Don’t let the behavior work to get technology back – otherwise the child will keep doing it. Stay as calm as you can, so that you don’t give the child a big reaction, and let your child have a calm-down period. (Kids who have frequent tantrums benefit from a place in their house to calm down safely, like a bean bag chair or small tent in their room). You might need to redirect aggressive behavior (for example, by directing them to punch a pillow, do “grounding” exercises or something else with their body that calms them down).  

Once they have calmed down, let them express their feelings but also gently remind them about why you started setting media limits in the first place. It might also help to have another activity to transition them to at that point, such as looking at books or listening to music, or a shared activity with you – to show the child that boundaries around screens help make room for other things they like to do.   https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/early-childhood-questions/early-childhood-questions/setting-limitations-on-tech-time/

SCREEN TIME,I am looking for an evidence-based curriculum to teach in a middle school setting for screen time and sleep. I appreciate any suggestions you may have. ,AAP,"When teens struggle to find balance around digital media use, it can negatively impact their sleep. Adequate sleep is an important part of mental well-being and brain development for adolescents, so it is important to support adolescents in using digital media in ways that won’t negatively impact their sleep.

In research studies, when asked about social media use at bedtime, teens shared social motivations such as fear of missing out, feeling obligated to engage in online groups and conversations regardless of the time of day, and feeling guilty when not responding immediately to messages among the top reasons for why they are on at night despite having an awareness that delaying bedtime could cause tiredness the next day or cause interference with other priorities like homework. They also shared skepticism around the helpfulness of self-imposed restrictions like “do not disturb” settings. Given these experiences, we recommend introducing evidence-based curriculums that focus on balance, technology use and well-being at school as well as providing parents and caregivers with tips to support healthy digital media use at home.

Resources for Educators
Teens & Tech has a free curriculum for middle school educators on how adolescent brain development affects technology use and well-being. 
There are 6 modules, and module #5 titled “Sleep and Technology” focuses specifically on digital media and sleep.
The three lessons in the Sleep & Technology module focus on the importance of sleep, adolescent sleep needs and technology use before bed.
This curriculum was developed by the Winston National Center on Technology Use, Brain, and Psychological Development.
Teens & Tech also features “Teens Teaching Teens”, which is a series of videos created by undergraduate students at the University of North Carolina – Chapel Hill. Three of the videos focus on screen use and sleep (scroll down to view). 
Common Sense Education has a comprehensive digital citizenship curriculum for each grade level, including middle school. 
The Digital Citizenship Curriculum includes a unit on media balance & well-being. For the middle school grades (6-8), this unit emphasizes setting goals around healthy, balanced media use. This unit could be helpful in discussing goals and boundaries around digital media use and sleep.
In addition to media balance & well-being, other units include privacy & security, digital footprint, relationships & communication, cyberbullying and news & media literacy.
The Digital Citizenship Curriculum includes lesson plans, student hand-outs, interactive activities, videos, games and a chart illustrating how the curriculum fits within Common Core standards. Common Sense suggests 5 instructional models for how this curriculum can be taught in schools. 
Media Power Youth has a curriculum called Screenshots, which is a media literacy curriculum for grades 6-8. 
This curriculum includes lesson plans, podcasts, a project and an interactive notebook.
The curriculum focuses on thinking critically about social media messages, managing online conflict, exploring how digital media relates to substance use, and practicing empathy when navigating online challenges. This curriculum does not focus on sleep specifically.
Resources to Recommend to Parents & Caregivers
Screen Sanity has a tool called the Social Media Playbook, which is a guide for caregivers and their children to navigate and discuss social media together. 
Screen Sanity has companion workbooks for parents of preschoolers, elementary schoolers, and middle schoolers that go along with the Social Media Playbook. Here’s the link to the workbook for middle school parents.

SCREEN TIME,What are some screen time guidelines for social media applications?,AAP,"Answer: It can be tempting to want a set number of hours on screens that is “safe” or healthy to guide your family’s technology use. Unfortunately, there isn’t enough evidence demonstrating a benefit from specific screen time limitation guidelines. For this reason, the American Academy of Pediatrics updated their media use recommendations in 2016. These evidence-based guidelines do not give a set screen time limit that applies to all children and teens. Because children and adolescents can have many different kinds of interactions with technology, rather than setting a guideline for specific time limits on digital media use, we recommend considering the quality of interactions with digital media and not just the quantity, or amount of time.

It is important to consider the specific activities that children and teens engage in on social media, and to support them in using social media in ways that strengthen their social, emotional, cognitive and identity development. When it comes to household rules around technology use, there is evidence that rules focusing on content, co-viewing and communication are associated with better well-being outcomes than rules focused on screen time.  https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/middle-childhood/middle-childhood-questions/screen-time-guidelines/",https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/middle-childhood/middle-childhood-questions/screen-time-guidelines/
SCREEN TIME,How Can I Help My Kids Develop Good Screen Time Habits?,Common Sense,"With older kids and teens spending more time on screens than ever before, it's natural for parents and caregivers to wonder if it's affecting their children's well-being. When it comes to screen time, it's important to make sure kids balance their time on devices with other activities that help them learn and grow.

Here are some strategies for helping your whole family develop a healthy relationship with screens.

Set limits. Establish screen-free zones and weekly screen-time amounts. Aim for a balance of activities throughout the week: reading, playing, spending time with family and friends, and so on. You can also use a family tech planner with your child and revise the rules as needed.

Choose age-appropriate, high-quality content. Not everything has to be educational, but when choosing entertainment for young kids, think about how it engages your child. If you have older kids, check out online reviews together and help them look for shows, games, and apps that allow them to explore their interests, get creative, and connect with others.

Watch and play together when you can. You won't be able to stop what you're doing every time your kid plays Minecraft, but make an effort to understand -- and even appreciate -- what your kids are doing. Ask questions, get them to explain stuff, and listen with an open mind.

Treat tech as a tool, not a treat. Kids who use tablets or smartphones just to play games or watch shows see only the entertainment side of technology. Show them how you can use devices for other tasks, such as sending emails, getting directions, and looking up information.

Be a family of media critics. Help your kids think critically about what they watch, play, and interact with by talking about it. Encourage them to think more deeply about the shows, books, and games they enjoy. Ask questions like, Who made this? Why do you like this character? Does it remind you of anything?

Be a role model. Lead by example and put your own devices away during family time. Mute notifications during mealtimes, turn off the television when no one is watching it, and try not to multitask while using devices. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-i-help-my-kids-develop-good-screen-time-habits",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-i-help-my-kids-develop-good-screen-time-habits
SCREEN TIME,How Much Screen Time Is OK for My Kids?,Common Sense,"Kids are spending more time with digital devices -- and at younger ages -- than ever before. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the World Health Organization (WHO) have helpful guidelines for limiting screen time for young kids. The reality is, there's no magic number that's just right for every child. What's important is the quality of kids' content, how your kids engage with it, and balancing their time with and without screens in ways that are healthy and support their development.

Simply calling all device use ""screen time"" can miss some important differences. Common Sense research studies identify four main categories of screen time:

Passive: mindlessly watching videos or shows, scrolling, on autopilot

Interactive: playing games, problem-solving

Communication: video-chatting, using social media ​

Content creation: making digital art or music, coding

Clearly, there are a lot of differences between these activities. And as valuable as many of them can be, it's still important for kids' overall healthy development to balance their lives with enriching experiences away from screens. These tips can help:

Pay attention to how your kids act during and after watching TV, playing video games, or hanging out online. There's no need to worry as long as:

They're using high-quality and age-appropriate content.

Their behavior is positive.

Screen time is balanced with other parts of life like sleep, connecting with family and friends, and time outdoors.

If you're worried about too much time on devices, consider creating a schedule that works for your family.

Include limits on how long kids can use devices, the kinds of devices they can use, and the types of activities or programs they can choose.

Get kids' input so the plan teaches critical thinking skills and self-regulation.

Find out what they like to watch, introduce new shows and apps for them to try, or plan a family movie night.

The AAP's guidelines allow for some screen time for children younger than 2. For this age group, parental involvement is essential. They recommend the following for parents and caregivers:

Under 18 months: Avoid screen time other than video-chatting.

Age 18–24 months: Find high-quality programming (if you choose to introduce screen time), and watch or play together.

Age 2–5: Limit screen use to one hour per day of high-quality programs.

Create a family media plan with consistent rules, and enforce them for older kids.

The reality is that most families will go through periods of heavy and light screen use, but as long as there's a balance, kids should be just fine. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-much-screen-time-is-ok-for-my-kids",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-much-screen-time-is-ok-for-my-kids
SCREEN TIME,Are Some Types of Screen Time Better Than Others?,Common Sense,"For sure. There's a huge difference between an hour spent shooting zombies in an app versus an hour spent composing music online.

That's not to say that everything has to be stamped ""educational"" to provide an enriching experience. With any screen media you choose for your kids (or they choose for themselves) -- movies, games, TV shows, apps -- you want to look for how it engages your child. There's nothing wrong with a little mindless entertainment. But your kids will get more out of their screen time if you consider these ""four C's.""

Connection.
It's really important that kids connect on a personal level with what they're watching, playing, or reading. Are they engaged? Engrossed? Maybe even enlightened? Getting into a storyline or identifying with characters prepares kids for more learning.

Critical thinking.
Look for TV shows, apps, games, and more that take a deep dive into a topic, subject, or skill. Maybe it's games in which kids think through ethical dilemmas or strategize about bypassing obstacles. Quizzes and simple Q&A-style games may be fun and seem educational, but they don't help kids find deep or long-lasting meaning.

Creativity.
Many great learning tools give kids the ability to create something new -- a new level for a video game or a song, for instance. Kids can feel more ownership of their learning when they get to put their own spins on the experience.

Context.
Help your kids understand how their online or screen-time activities fit into the larger world. For younger kids in particular, the discussions and activities surrounding games or movies are key. Being with kids while they play or watch, asking questions about what they're taking away, and doing related offline activities can extend learning. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/are-some-types-of-screen-time-better-than-others",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/are-some-types-of-screen-time-better-than-others
SCREEN TIME,How much screen time is really OK for babies under 2?,Common Sense,"Some parents worry that exposing their kids to any TV or screen time could be damaging. Take it from us: A little bit of media isn't gonna hurt. It's heavy exposure to screen media -- for example, constant background TV, devices in the bedroom, and using media as a babysitter that can have a negative impact on babies' and toddlers' cognitive, physical, and emotional development.

Choosing high-quality media, co-viewing and co-playing, and using media as a means of furthering and cementing your relationship with your kids is absolutely OK. The most important thing is that time spent with screens doesn't replace time spent with a loving caregiver.

According to new recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), parents can safely introduce digital media to children at 18 months. Relationship-strengthening activities such as videochatting with relatives can be introduced as early as 16 months. Here are some ideas for sharing media with kids under 2 in small amounts (say, 15 or 30 minutes).

Explore new words, ideas, sounds, and pictures online.
Show kids photos of themselves and name parts of their faces.
Scroll through all your pictures, name the people, and talk about them.

SCREEN TIME,How do I put a stop to screen time (turn off the TV or take the phone away) without causing a meltdown?,Common Sense,"Helping kids regulate their own media use is an ongoing process, and along the way you're likely to experience some struggles when it's time to turn off the TV or any other digital device. Try the tips below when enforcing your screen limits without causing meltdowns or tantrums.

When it's time to transition from TV watching to another activity, using prerecorded shows comes in handy. On traditional broadcast TV, one show flows into another, but when you use the DVR, a DVD, or even a streaming-video service, your kid can turn off the TV when the show is over.

If you don't have any of these options, consider using the ""watch later"" feature on YouTube. The site allows you to select and add videos to a playlist. Your kids can simply watch what you've selected together.

To mitigate the meltdowns, try these things:

Have a plan. Explain beforehand to your kid that he or she can watch a certain number of shows or for a specific time period. Let them know what to expect after the show, too.

Create a routine. Kids who know they have to turn off the TV before a specific activity (like dinner) can sometimes transition more easily.

Show your kids how to turn off the TV. They may enjoy practicing that skill, and it will give them some power over their situation, which they'll appreciate.

Avoid back-to-back shows. If you're using a streaming service, disable the setting that automatically plays the next show in a series.

Try giving a two-minute warning. Prepping kids for the inevitable works for some.

Turn it off and stick to your guns. Some kids react better when they're not warned in advance that the show is ending -- possibly because they've come to expect the fight.

Give praise. If your child successfully transitions to another activity without a meltdown, show your appreciation. Say something like, ""Thanks for turning off the TV and coming to set the table!"" Kids will be more likely to follow through again when they have a positive experience. 

If your baby or child has a tantrum when you take the phone or tablet away, just use your normal consequences. It shouldn't be any different with devices. A lot of parents worry that a tantrum means a child has developed an unhealthy attachment to the phone or tablet, but that's very unlikely. If handing over the phone has become a habit, it'll take some time to curb outbursts. Little kids also don't typically understand the ""five-minute countdown"" (i.e., that they have only five more minutes with the device before they have to give it up.) Babies are very much in the moment -- they want what they want when they want it. Here are some ways that may cut down on tantrums over devices.

Transition into using the phone or tablet together -- such as showing her photos of herself or watching short videos together -- so she'll get used to it being a shared experience.
Begin to show her how you use the phone as a tool, such as to make calls -- not a treat that she gets from being ""good.""
As with everything else she wants and can't have, she'll develop the ability to self-soothe with your help.
What's your strategy for avoiding tantrums when you take the phone away from baby?

SCREEN TIME,How do I deal with managing screen time along with online homework?,Common Sense,"If you're like me, you've recently attended your kid's back-to-school night and have made two disturbing discoveries. One, your kid's math classroom smells like old socks. And two, a good amount of schoolwork this year, from homework to group projects, will be on the computer. Managing all that screen time, when your kid's world already feels way too screen-y, seems impossible. We know—a lot of us have been through it. This week, we're sharing our tried-and-true strategies for working this all out. As for the sock smell, you're on your own!

Why all the online homework in the first place?

If homework sounds like ""clickety-clack,"" it's not your imagination. More and more teachers are migrating schoolwork to the computer. While it can be a pain for you to manage, the shift has some real benefits. For starters, kids tend to like it—and that's a good thing where homework is concerned. But online work has a few advantages over pencil and paper.

It's more relevant to kid's lives. Today's kids go to YouTube, Wikipedia, and Khan Academy whenever they want to learn more about something that they're interested in, whether it's skateboarding or the solar system. They can use these same sources for homework because they know and understand them.

It can teach responsible online behavior. It's tough to get away with cyberbullying a classmate on Google Docs when you sit right next to them in social studies. By using digital tools, kids learn valuable lessons that translate directly to the working world such as respectful communication, collaboration, and that what you post has a direct impact on others.

It gives students and teachers instant feedback. Some software, including IXL and BrainPOP, identifies where kids are proficient and where they need work. Pinpointing the trouble spots means kids won't get bored reviewing stuff they know and lets teachers provide tailored instruction to improve students' understanding.

It can introduce kids to new concepts. The internet has approximately a bajillion videos of how atoms combine to create a molecule. Do you want your kid to watch them all? No. Do you want your kid to watch as many as they need to understand the concept? Yes.

It allows teachers to focus on teaching. By automating mundane tasks such as grading, teachers are freed up to spend more time on what's really important—instilling a love of learning in their students.

When is tech not good for kids' learning?

Educational experts agree that technology shouldn't replace many aspects of traditional teaching. All kids learn differently, so a variety of methods is the most effective way of reaching every kid. And honestly, there are some aspects of learning where pencil and paper are just better. For example:

Writing by hand helps kids process information. The brain activity that occurs when you jot notes down helps you retain information better.

Kids can be more expressive. Because it's input-output, technology has its limits on self-expression and creativity.

It's harder to cheat. Technology makes it ridiculously easy for kids to get answers without doing the work.

How can I make sure my kid is not really playing Fortnite when he says he's doing homework?

When kids work online, you have very little visibility into what they're doing. One concern parents have is that if homework is on a laptop, kids can easily switch between studying and gaming without you knowing. Also, YouTube rabbit holes. Your kid's teacher can help you determine the ""school"" side of the screen-time equation. These questions can help guide that conversation:

Ask the teacher how much time should be spent online. Are students expected to do all their homework online, do only some of their homework, or use only a few apps? Some apps time kids' sessions, which gives teachers feedback on an individual student's proficiency—even on individual problems. If you have that data, you can get a gauge of whether your kid is on track, stuck on something, or possibly dillydallying.

Ask the purpose of the technology. It's perfectly OK to ask what software your kid will be using, how it was selected, and what the learning purpose is. There's a huge range of educational apps, websites, and games available, and teachers may use a variety of ways to find the ones that will really benefit kids' learning. Understanding the learning purpose will help you know what to ask when you check in on your kid's progress.

Find out how you fit in. Ask your teacher how you can continue to support your kid's online learning and monitor interactions (if necessary). The software may have a teacher dashboard that can be shared with parents or a parent log-in, or the teacher can give you access to your kid's account.

But, I already feel like we're fighting every day about screen time!

When schools started assigning online homework, a lot of us felt like we were no longer in control of how screen time worked in our homes. How many of us have asked our kid to get off the computer only to have them answer, ""But I'm doing homework!"" Fear not! You can still assert control—and your kid can still get their homework done. Here's how:

Keep the computer in a central location—not the bedroom. Being out in the open will encourage them to stay on task and help you keep an eye on them.

Talk about the myths of multitasking. It's going to make homework last even longer and make it harder to retain information if they skip back and forth between watching PewDiePie and writing an essay.

Ask your kid to show you what they're doing. Understanding the tools their teachers are using with them will help you get a sense of how long things should take and what they're really doing when they're online.

Have a cut-off point. No matter what, make sure kids shut off devices at least an hour before bedtime. Their brains need time to chill so they can get a good night's sleep. You can use parental controls to make this happen automatically if necessary.

Use a productivity app. Apps that help kids stay on task, such as timers, goal-setters, and distraction blockers can be super motivational.

It just feels like too much screen time overall.

Screens are not inherently bad for kids. If they're learning or having fun in a positive way—that's a good thing! But what you might be sensing is that they're missing out on important non-screen activities because so much of their learning and entertainment time is spent with a device. Balance is important for kids (and for everyone else). Here's what you can do to make sure screens aren't taking over your kid's life:

Get some physical activity—away from screens. Stretch, meditate, take the dog for a walk, go for a bike ride, or have a little dance party.

Read. Reading is really good for kids. You can read to your kid (even older tweens benefit from being read to), take turns reading pages to each other, or just sit together reading your own stuff.

Establish device-free times and zones. Having non-negotiable boundaries around when tech is not welcome—for example, at dinnertime or in bedrooms at night—helps kids find other stuff to do that's not screen based.  https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-deal-with-managing-screen-time-along-with-online-homework",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-deal-with-managing-screen-time-along-with-online-homework
SCREEN TIME,What's the best way to manage screen time?,Common Sense,"At Common Sense we talk to parents every day who worry and wonder about screen time's effect on their kids' social, emotional, and physical health. When our kids were little, it was about balancing time in front of the tablet or TV with real-world activities. But now, it's about YouTube rabbit holes, texts with people they hardly know, requests for Instagram accounts, and talking to strangers on Fortnite. The hours we hope our children will spend reading books, playing outside, or having IRL conversations (with eye contact!) they spend glued to screens.

According to our research, screen time among American kids is off the charts, having reached more than two hours a day for kids age 0 to 8, with 4.5 for tweens and more than six for teens. (But before you yank that device out of their hands, consider this: Adults are on our screens a staggering nine hours per day.) The data shows that screen time disrupts sleep, causes family tension, and can even affect the social and emotional health of the most vulnerable kids.

So what's a parent to do?

Don't panic—the kids are (probably) all right. And there are some easy ways to see if they're not. Ask yourself, are they:

Getting enough sleep?
Physically healthy?
Connecting socially with family and friends?
Engaged with and achieving at school?
Pursuing interests and hobbies?
If you answered yes to all these questions, you may not have to worry about screen time after all. But pay attention to any ""no"" answers and consider whether screen use is part of the problem.

Screen time red flags

1. Create a family media agreement. Younger kids especially will respond to being included in decisions around screen rules. When introducing a family media agreement to tweens or teens, take the opportunity to share the research and your concerns, and the agreement will seem like a rational approach.

2. Use parental controls. Today there are parent controls for every device, from Alexa to the iPhone to the Switch. They can help you monitor time spent, restrict where kids visit and what they can do (or buy), who they're interacting with, and so much more. The only caveat: Don't let parental controls prevent you from parenting. Navigating the digital world is a constant conversation.

3. Set up device-free times and zones. No laptops or cellphones in the bedroom. No texting after 8 p.m. Charge phones in the kitchen overnight. No devices at the dinner table. Kids crave structure and are often relieved to be free of their devices (it's actually stressful if you never take a break). But the only way to make this strategy successful is for you to follow these same rules.

4. Pause for people. When someone enters the room or the conversation, pressing pause or putting the phone down is essential for manners, connectedness, and teaching kids that people come first.

5. Choose quality. If your kid is using their device to compose sonatas, watch award-winning documentary films, or even play a game that teaches strategy, there may be no reason to stop them. Active or enriching experiences (versus passive consumption) is the key to time well spent in front of a screen.



Sending the screens to Siberia is not the best solution.

Yes, the research shows that kids who are on their screens too much are unhappy, especially the kids who are already at risk for depression or anxiety.

But research also shows that kids who are entirely device-free are unhappy as well. Like it or not, devices are where kids spend their social lives. It's how they communicate, play, learn, and expand their world. So cutting them off can have negative consequences.

Tech acts as an amplifier: It can make a happy kid happier and a sad kid depressed; turns out that different kids need different amounts. And as parents, our challenge is to figure out what that amount is. (Did I mention this wasn't going to be easy?)

One final thought

What works for you and your family today may not work as well tomorrow. And what works for one kid may not work for another. Consider your own families' needs and your kid's nature to figure out rules that work best. By exploring solutions together, we can build healthier, happier families.  https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/whats-the-best-way-to-manage-screen-time",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/whats-the-best-way-to-manage-screen-time
"BULLYING, HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION ","Do you know of any effective “diversion/intervention” type programming designed for kids who have struggled to maintain a healthy relationship with social media and with classmates on social media? I am looking for an educational resource designed for middle school students who have, unfortunately, used social media to be unkind, bully, promote false information, etc.",AAP,"Answer: The good news is that anti-cyberbullying school-based intervention programs have been shown to significantly reduce cyberbullying. There is less evidence, however, that many of the new digital citizenship school-based programs that strive to teach students how to navigate digital technologies and their social ecosystems in healthy ways actually change students’ behaviors.

What Educators Can Do
Assess whether you need to implement a bullying, cyberbullying or digital citizenship program.
Anti-cyberbullying programs that focus specifically on cyberbullying seem to be the most effective compared to those that focus on general violence prevention or general bullying behavior.
Digital citizenship programs have the benefit of teaching not just about cyberbullying, but overall healthy internet behaviors.
Collaborate and get feedback from key stakeholders— teachers, parents and students— on what type of programs they think would be effective for their school environment and what curriculum to include in a program.
Assess your school culture and resources to provide training programs (e.g., monetary resources, individuals involved in implementation, classroom time).
Strive to provide teachers adequate time and training with curriculum materials to ensure consistent delivery across classrooms.
Implement intervention programs over at least an entire academic year and across K through 12 to improve outcomes, if possible, as recommended across studies by researchers, teachers, and students.
If you are interested in Digital Citizenship programs, we recommend looking at this book chapter by Weinstein and James (2022): Chapter 15: School-Based Initiatives Promoting Digital Citizenship and Health Digital Media Use (see page 369 for table with overview of programs)
These researchers note to avoid curricula that do not align with research such as:
Using the language of “addiction” to characterize everyday media habits.
Describing a causal relationship between media activities and mental health issues (e.g., depression, anxiety, suicide risk).
Emphasizing total screen time without any attention to the types of digital activities that comprise that time.
Including potentially problematic messages and examples of simplistic and likely ineffective instructional approaches (e.g., just telling all students “Don’t compare yourself to others on social media”) (see Weinstein, 2017 for context on why this approach may fall short).
Lessons with a clear implication that offline activities are inherently more worthwhile than any online activities.
 

If you are interested in Anti-Cyberbullying programs, we recommend reading a review and meta-analysis by Polanin and colleagues (2022) who identified programs with 7 different components (none of these components are necessarily more effective):

"BULLYING, HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION ",What Is Online Harassment?,Common Sense,"Online harassment is when someone uses technology -- like cellphones, computers, social media, or gaming platforms -- to bully, threaten, or aggressively hassle someone. A form of cyberbullying, online harassment includes name-calling, stalking, and physical threats. Girls and LGBTQ+ individuals are more likely to experience these types of harassment and abuse.

Parents and caregivers can support their kids by understanding that relationships these days are often played out both online and offline. Kids and teens may need adults' guidance in establishing appropriate boundaries. The tips below can help you help your kids navigate these murky waters so they can avoid harm for themselves and their friends.

Start a discussion. Your kid may not tell you if they experienced online harassment or saw it happen to someone else. But you can bring it up when you talk about online safety, responsible behavior, and how to respond to offensive comments. Tell them about resources such as StopBullying.gov.

Let them know you're always there for them. Remind your kids often that you're always available to talk. While you're at it, remind them that they can also talk to a school counselor, a teacher, or other family members they trust. Knowing that they have a trusted adult to talk to may encourage your kids to open up.

Help them set boundaries. Encourage them to never to do anything that's outside their comfort zones, such as sharing passwords, talking to strangers, or sending sexually explicit photos. (It never hurts to remind them that anything you send can travel far and wide online.)

Take action. Online harassment can be traumatic, and can negatively affect one's mental health. If you find out your kid has been threatened or blackmailed, report the issue to school administrators, law enforcement, or community members who can help.  https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-is-online-harassment",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-is-online-harassment
"BULLYING, HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION ",What Should I Do If My Child Is Bullied Online?,Common Sense,"Finding out that your child has been cyberbullied is emotional. You or your child might want to retaliate, but it's best to help your child deescalate the situation. Give them strategies to protect themselves and try to stop the bullying. Here are the immediate steps we recommend for parents and caregivers:

Reassure your child that you love and support them.

Help your child step away from the computer or device and take a break.

If you can identify the bully, and it's another child, consider talking with their parents.

Consider contacting your child's school. If bullying is happening online, it might be happening offline, too.

Empower your child with specific steps they can take (see below).

Kids may not always recognize teasing as bullying. Some kids may also be too embarrassed or ashamed to talk to adults about it. It's important to talk about safe online behavior with kids before they start going online or get their own phone.

To prepare your child for going online, or if you know they're being bullied, share these steps they can take right away:

Turn off the screen. Ignore the attacks and walk away.

Don't respond or retaliate. If you're angry or hurt, you might say things you'll regret later. People who cyberbully often want to get a reaction out of you, so don't let them know their plans have worked.

Block the bully. If you get mean messages through social media, take the person off your friends list or block them. You can also delete messages from the person without reading them.

Use reporting tools. Many apps and websites offer ways you can report or flag bullying. The site might block or suspend the user.

Save or take a screenshot of bullying messages. If the harassment continues, save the evidence. This could be important proof to show parents or teachers if the bullying doesn't stop.

Talk to a friend. When someone makes you feel bad, it can help to talk the situation over with a friend.

Tell a trusted adult. A trusted adult is someone you believe will listen and who has the skills, desire, and authority to help you. Telling an adult isn't tattling -- it's standing up for yourself. And even if the bullying occurs online, your school probably has rules against it. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-do-if-my-child-is-bullied-online",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-do-if-my-child-is-bullied-online
"BULLYING, HARASSMENT, DISCRIMINATION ",What if I see online discrimination?,APA,"The online community often reflects the world we live in. Unfortunately, this includes discrimination, prejudice, hate speech, and bullying. Teach children to critique racist messages and recognize online structural racism. Research shows young people who can critically evaluate racist content experience fewer mental illness symptoms when they witness race-related traumatic events online. Every teen has the chance to help all feel equal and valued by the choices they make online.",https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/social-media-literacy-teens
ONLINE SAFETY ,How do I teach my kids to protect themselves online?,Common Sense,"Every one of us is willing to do whatever it takes to keep our kids safe. But as kids get older, parental heroics become less and less feasible. So it's on to Plan B: Empowering them to protect themselves. This leap of faith is one of the scariest things we do as parents, but it's also the best way to safeguard them against potential risks—online and off. And you can rehearse. We've got a few simple but incredibly effective methods you can use to help kids practice the self-protection skills they need—including how to recognize red flag feelings, identify typical internet trouble spots, and hear your voice in their head warning ""danger ahead""—so you and your kid can both feel confident in their ability to manage whatever comes their way.

Quick Take
Help kids do a gut check. Instead of telling kids not to talk to strangers, say, ""If someone makes you feel weird, trust that feeling."" Use the tools below to help kids learn to identify and trust their red flag feelings so they make safe choices.
Review the risky spots. Iffy stuff can happen anywhere, but certain types of games, apps, and websites cultivate an edgier environment. Likewise, certain interactions, such as someone asking a kid their gender, should send up big danger signals. Specific examples of these to go over with your kids are below.
Allow for missteps. Taking risks is part of growing up. Your kid may have noticed their red flag feelings, and proceeded against their better judgment anyway. Stress the importance of staying safe and secure—but let them know that if they mess up they can—and should—come to you or another trusted grown-up who can help them get out of any sticky situations.
What are red-flag feelings?
Red flag feelings are those that make you feel uncomfortable, worried, sad, or anxious. While some kids are wired to make their moods known to everyone in shouting distance, some kids have a harder time with negative emotions: admitting them, naming them, managing them, and even trusting them.

How do I teach my kid to recognize red-flag feelings?
It's important to discuss feelings in concrete terms so kids have the words to express what they're experiencing. The goal is to help them learn to manage those feelings without getting overwhelmed or acting out. A clear head helps you make good decisions. This thinking routine helps kids connect their thoughts and feelings:

F.I.R.E. This stands for feel, identify, reflect, and enact. It was co-created with researchers from the Harvard Graduate School of Education as an easy-to-memorize cue to help kids to take stock and think clearly. To work through red flag feelings when kids are online (or anywhere, really), remind them to slow down, pause, and remember F.I.R.E.

Feel. Take the pulse of your emotions. Are you feeling sad, anxious, jealous, excluded, or uncomfortable? If not, what emotion captures how you feel?
Identify. Think about what caused you to have this feeling. What happened? Was it something you—or someone else—said or did?
Reflect. Consider possible responses. What choices of action are available to you? What are the benefits or drawbacks—for you and for others—of each step you might take?
Enact. Take steps to act. How can you move forward to address the situation in a way that feels positive and productive—for you and for others?
The Mood Meter. This app was developed by Mark Brackett at the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence and it uses colors to help kids identify what they're feeling. It divides feelings into four quadrants—red, blue, green, and yellow—allowing kids to pick the color that best represents their state of mind. Download The Mood Meter and use it with your kids to help them gain self-awareness in any situation.

What kinds of interactions lead to red-flag feelings?
Bullying, insults, and other aggressive behavior are obvious triggers of red flag feelings. But kids may be confused by interactions that seem nice—or start off that way. Feel free to play-act different scenarios based on the games, apps, social media, and other platforms your kids tend to use the most. Be specific about the kinds of conversations kids may encounter so that they can recognize triggers, such as:

Asking to keep any information secret.
Flirting.
Asking about anything private (phone number, address, school name, whether they're a boy or a girl).
Pressuring them or making them feel pressured to do anything.
Causing them to feel untrue to themselves or their values.
Asking to meet in person or requesting personal pictures.
Inviting them to chat but telling them not to tell anyone else.
Encouraging them to move their chat to a different platform than the one they started on.
What should I tell my kids to do when they have red-flag feelings?
Your kids may have good ideas for how to respond when they're experiencing weird feelings, so first ask them how they might respond. Here are some more ideas:

Change the subject, make a joke, or say, ""I don't want to talk about this.""
Log off or quit.
Unfriend the person or block them; create a new account, or report the other user.
Never plan a face-to-face meeting with someone you do not know unless you take along a parent or guardian.
Ask a trusted adult for advice or help if you feel unsure or uncomfortable in any situation.
Don't send private information or photos.
What platforms should I be most concerned about?
Unfortunately, any platform where people interact can provoke red flag feelings. Most apps, games, and social media have safety measures in place, including both human monitors and algorithmic tricks, to suss out inappropriate behavior. And kids are actually pretty savvy about the kinds of interactions that seem off. Still, kids may end up in riskier areas, and they should be extra careful when using:

Anonymous apps. These are apps where users' identities are hidden, and they are breeding grounds for bullying. Ex. Yolo: Q&A.

""Temporary"" message apps. Kids may be emboldened to send things they think won't last—but nothing ever really disappears. Ex. Snapchat.

Random video chatting. These apps connect strangers all over the world—and they're notorious for inappropriate behavior. Plus, video chatting can't be monitored. Ex. HOLLA: Live Random Video Chat.

Livestreaming. There are no take-backs when you broadcast yourself in real time. Ex. BIGO Live—Livestream.

Secret chat rooms. The intimacy of invite-only chat rooms can prompt kids to do things they wouldn't otherwise do. Ex. Discord.

Checking in
Modeling the kind of mind-body connection it takes to trust your gut is one of the most powerful tools you have as a parent—but it doesn't always come naturally. Use the F.I.R.E. method yourself to get comfortable with it. For example, you can say to your kid: ""I feel sad because of something I saw on Facebook. When I feel this way, I log off and do something that makes me feel good—like talking to you."" https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-teach-my-kids-to-protect-themselves-online",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-teach-my-kids-to-protect-themselves-online
ONLINE SAFETY ,What Should I Teach My Child About Safe Online Behavior?,Common Sense,"As soon as your kids start going online, it's important to explain your expectations for their behavior. With some guidance from you, they can enjoy their time online and mostly avoid things like cyberbullying and inappropriate content. Here are some basics to share with your child:

Communicate with care. Use the right language for your audience. You might write or speak differently to a teacher, compared with a friend.

Keep private things private. Don't share private information, including passwords, your home address, date of birth, your location, or revealing photos.

Respect others and avoid drama. Be courteous and practice disagreeing politely. Try not to interact with trolls or share gossip.

Don't lie, steal, or cheat. Don't try to deceive others. Remember to give credit where credit is due. And, although it's easy to copy others' work, download things without permission, or cheat in online games, don't do it.

Be an ""upstander."" If someone you know is being bullied, find a way to show your support. If you feel safe confronting the one doing the bullying, you should. If not, a private message to the target of the bullying can be enough to help someone through a tough time. Speaking up against hate speech is important, too.

Report misbehavior. The internet is a giant community, and you can help it be a nicer place.

Follow your family's rules. If your parent or caregiver tells you to avoid certain websites or to stop texting after a certain time, do your best to respect their wishes. The more you act responsibly, the more privileges you'll get.

Think before you post, text, or share. Consider how you and others might feel after you've posted something. It's not always easy to take back what you've said online, and your online behavior can create a lasting footprint.

Check in with your feelings. Some online experiences can have a negative effect on our mental and emotional well-being. If you ever feel uncomfortable, worried, sad, or anxious, try taking a break and reach out to a friend or adult for help. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-teach-my-child-about-safe-online-behavior",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-i-teach-my-child-about-safe-online-behavior
ONLINE SAFETY ,I'm an adolescent medicine physician preparing a presentation on cybersafety for teens for an upcoming presentation to general pediatricians on how to best support their patients with social media use. Do you have any helpful resources or guides that you think I should include or reference in my talk as I prepare?,AAP,"This is a critical topic to address as studies show that nearly half of adolescents have dealt with harassment online in the form of offensive name-calling (32%), unwanted pornographic images (17%) and threats of physical violence (10%) (Vogels, 2022).

At the same time, it is also important to avoid messages that incite moral panic or send a message that all teens will face serious danger online that they cannot handle. A key element of any approach is to empower adolescents to have agency in navigating the online world and have support to reach out to others if they face a situation that is worrisome to them.

A comprehensive approach to cybersafety includes addressing the emotional safety, physical safety, and privacy of teens.

Although 59% of middle school students demonstrated that they understood appropriate online behaviors, how to protect personal/private information and how to respond if contacted by an internet predator, less than half of those students indicated they would tell a trusted adult if threatening or unkind things were said about them on social media or if they were contacted by a stranger (Kite et al., 2019). Given these findings, it is important for adults to encourage adolescents in their life to come to them with concerns about cybersafety, in addition to educating teens about online safety and privacy.

Along a similar vein, current research emphasizes that family communication is essential in reducing teen’s online risky behaviors (Rutkowski et al., 2021). Transparency, teen involvement and teen-parent communication around online safety measures allows teens to have an active role in maintaining online safety and teaches them how to make responsible decisions on their own. From the teen’s perspective, restrictive rules around access to the internet diminished family communication overall.

Resources pediatricians and other clinicians can share with adolescents and their families:
For general advice or resources around screens and social media, we suggest reviewing this previously asked question regarding screen time guidelines.
Common Sense Media has created a number of resources regarding child and adolescent online safety and the ways in which parents, educators, and caregivers can facilitate safe and healthy digital engagement:
“How do I protect my kid's privacy online?”, “How can I protect my family’s data privacy?” and “Who is collecting my child’s data, and what are they doing with it?” are brief articles crafted for parents who are looking for strategies to better protect their children’s online privacy. Suggestions for parents include establishing privacy preferences during the initial set-up/registration of any app or website account, reading the fine print in Terms of Service agreements before using a personal email address to register for online accounts.
Common Sense has also created parent guides to a number of social media platforms and online games with specific recommendations to promote online safety in respective online spaces. Parent guides include comprehensive descriptions and parenting suggestions for Minecraft, Artificial Intelligence tools, TikTok, Discord, multiplayer online games, Apple AirDrop, Fortnite and more.

ONLINE SAFETY ,How can I protect my kid from online predators?,Common Sense,"Is there anything scarier than the thought of your kid chatting with a potential predator? Someone who ""grooms"" your child with attention, gifts, or money in return for sexual favors? It's every parent's nightmare. And in a world where our kids can easily text, video-chat, and exchange images with literally anyone on the internet, it feels totally appropriate to assume danger is around every corner. Except, it's not. Yes, kids are victimized online. But who's doing it and who's at risk can look a lot different from what we've been led to believe by sensationalist news reports and other fear-mongering. The best way to protect our kids is to have a clear picture of the facts about online predators.

How scared should we be about online predators?

Let's be clear: Kids are harassed online. As many as one in seven has experienced an unwanted sexual solicitation, according to University of New Hampshire's Youth Internet Safety Survey. But the reality is way more complicated, and not so much scary as sad. It's also important to know that when an incident happens, it's magnified. There's nothing media loves more than catching a predator. When it happens, the story is picked up by multiple news outlets. Everyone knows parents are scared about this, so the coverage is intense and widespread, and ends up seeming more common than it is.

Here's what the research says:

Kids are more likely to get harassed by other kids. Sending unsolicited, inappropriate photos, asking for sexual favors, and other unwelcome interactions often come from peers.

When kids are harassed, they know who it is. Just as in real life, predators pursue people they know.

Most online sexual predators aren't looking for little kids. They usually target adolescents, admit their age, and talk openly about sex.

Victims fit a profile. Kids who experience online harassment find it in the places you might expect: sexually oriented social media like dating, livestreaming, and certain chatting apps where visitors talk openly about sex. Victims are typically in some kind of crisis and are vulnerable. They may feel marginalized in the real world, may be questioning or exploring their sexual identity—and they may have posted sexual content themselves.

How can I make sure my kid is safe?

From the time our kids are little, we tell them not to talk to strangers. But in the real world, we put qualifiers on that rule all the time: ""If you get lost in a store, ask for the manager."" ""Help the elderly cross the street."" ""Order your own lemonade!"" In other words, we teach them to trust their gut, be assertive, and take care of themselves. And that's the same thing we need to teach them about being online.

But it's unrealistic to expect kids to never talk to strangers online. We also can't underestimate how much they already know about online creeps and how to avoid or ignore them. They've been navigating this online world far longer than we have. You gotta give them a little credit! To really protect our kids, we need to shift the focus to what really works: staying on top of what they're doing online by checking in—and really listening; helping them to establish healthy boundaries for themselves; and finally, talking about their personal safety.

A three-part plan:

Stay on top of kids' online lives. Be genuinely curious.

Ask them which apps, games, and other tech they use. Find out what they like about them, what they don't like, and what they would change if they could.
If they're on social media, friend or follow them. If you get pushback, offer not to comment and promise you won't judge. (If all else fails, enlist friends, relatives, or older siblings to keep an eye on their activity.)
Find out how they chat: Is it through an app or through their phone's SMS texting? If they're using an app, it won't be easy for you to see it without logging in to their account. If they're new to social media or you suspect a problem, initiate spot checks in exchange for allowing them to use their devices and accounts.
Help them set healthy boundaries and use privacy settings. Start with strict rules when kids are new to phones and social media. You can ease off later.

Set rules about times and places for device use. For example, banning phones and tablets from bedrooms.
Make rules around who they can chat with. For instance, friends of friends might be OK, but that's as far as they can go.
Empower them. Discuss what they should do if someone makes them feel uncomfortable. Make sure they know how to block and report people who engage in inappropriate conversations. If they don't, walk through the steps together.
Review the privacy settings for the apps they use. Help them enable the safest ones, such as setting their Instagram to private, to prevent unwanted contact or negative attention.
Talk about personal safety—and their responsibility in protecting it. Let's face it: Kids can get a little bolder online. They may experiment with Snapchat filters like the ""sexy puppy"" (yup, gross) or dance crazy in a TikTok video. If they receive suggestive comments, they may not know how to respond. Guiding them (delicately!) through the do's and don'ts is an important parenting move and one that will make them less susceptible to online sexual predators. Here are some ideas and tips to work into conversation:

""Exploring your identity can be thrilling—and scary. Remember that the persona you create online through your photos, videos, comments, and other aspects of your digital footprint could attract attention for things you didn't anticipate. If you get in too deep, you can always report or block someone, and please let me know if something has gone too far.""
""You can stop any interaction at any time. Even if you started chatting with someone online, you can stop it whenever you want to. Never feel pressured to keep something going if you've decided you're not into it or—especially—if it begins to feel weird.""
""Know the signs of creeps. Hopefully, you'll never encounter anyone with bad motives online. But it's good to know what to watch for.""
Here are 10 sexual predator red flags:

Keeping it secret. ""Don't tell anyone about our conversation.""
Not wanting to be traced. ""Let's move this conversation to a chat room I like.""
Threatening. ""If you don't send me nudes, I'll tell all your friends something really bad about you.""
Exploiting a weakness. ""If you don't send me more nudes, I'll share everything you already sent me with your parents.""
Trying to control others. ""You can't cut me off now. You started this!""
Invading your space. ""Since you blocked me on Insta, I'm friending you on Snap. I like you too much to stay away.""
Lying. ""I've never done this before.""
Setting themselves apart. ""You've got me all wrong; I'm not like other people.""
Manipulating. ""What's your Venmo? I just want to send you an early birthday present.""
Being abusive. ""You're bad, and when I'm done with you, everyone will know it.""
What to do if it happens to your kid:

Your first move is to make sure your kid is safe; consequences can come later. Support them emotionally and try to understand what led up to the problem. You both may need professional help.
Block and report the predator. If the predator is still connected to your kid's friends, it might be a good idea for your kid to unfriend or unfollow those kids until the situation is in hand. If there's a chance other kids could be in danger, work with your kid to make a plan to contact them or their parents.
Save all evidence: Check your kid's browser history, get your kid's cellphone history from your provider, search their email.
Make sure your kid's social media profiles are all private; consider suspending them temporarily.
If the predator solicited sex, sent inappropriate photos, asked for inappropriate photos, or made any threats, it's possible a crime was committed and you may need to contact law enforcement.
Has someone ever made inappropriate contact with your kid?

If you don't know, ask. Just talking about the issue gives you a chance to share your perspective, get your kid's input, and remind them you love them no matter what. It really is a complex issue, with deeper roots than what appears at the surface. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-i-protect-my-kid-from-online-predators",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-can-i-protect-my-kid-from-online-predators
ONLINE SAFETY ,Are strangers and pedophiles really the biggest risk to young kids who go online?,Common Sense,"No, though they certainly are the issue that scares parents the most. Cyberbullying and exposure to age-inappropriate content remain the biggest risks to kids who are active online. Still, the benefits of the online world outweigh the negatives by far.

By staying involved, you can keep kids safe and teach them how to use digital technology responsibly. Start by showing interest in the sites they visit and the games they play, and your job will be a lot easier when they start exploring these technologies more independently.

Strategies for a responsible -- and safer -- online life:

Visit age-appropriate sites. Check out a site before your kids visit it. Know what features and content exist, and make sure they're good for your kids.
Search safely. Use safe-search settings for young kids, or think about applying filtering software to limit inappropriate exposure.
Avoid strangers. Tell your kids that people aren't always who they say they are online. Explain that if someone they don't know talks to them, they should let you know.
Be a good cyber citizen. A good rule of thumb: If they wouldn't do something in real life, they shouldn't do it online. Find out how your children can report mean behavior or unkind content on their favorite websites, and teach them how to do it.
Keep the computer or device in a central place. That way you can see what's going on.
Discuss expectations. Come up with a plan together about the amount of time your kids spend online and what they do. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/are-strangers-and-pedophiles-really-the-biggest-risk-to-young-kids-who-go-online",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/are-strangers-and-pedophiles-really-the-biggest-risk-to-young-kids-who-go-online
ONLINE SAFETY ,Is it safe for teens to use location apps?,Common Sense,"As with most technology, there are positives and negatives about teens using location apps on their phones. On the one hand, apps such as Find My Friends and Gone Out - Later Folks can help friends find each other at a concert or other large gathering. Parents also can use them to keep track of a teen's location. And many of these apps have safety features that restrict who can see a user's location. (Learn about Snapchat's ""Snap Map"" feature which lets friends see each others' locations on a map.)

On the other hand, because they broadcast your teen's physical location, they open up the possibility of meeting strangers face to face or enabling someone to follow your teen without their knowledge. Also, these apps don't work if the phone is turned off or out of battery, preventing you from tracking your kid, if that's your goal.

Location-sharing apps also are big targets for advertisers who want to make your kid a customer. Checking in at the Starbucks earns him or her a coupon. Walking by a store in the mall prompts a ""sale"" alert on his or her phone. The data tracking that these apps do is a big overreach into teen's consumer privacy, and companies are not always transparent about what they're collecting and how they use the information.

Some teens will use these apps no matter what you say, so at least set ground rules: Have strict privacy settings, avoid public location-sharing, and consider requiring that you follow them. Get them to buy you a coffee with their coupon, too.

Do you think it's safe for teens to use location apps? https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-safe-for-teens-to-use-location-apps",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-safe-for-teens-to-use-location-apps
GAMING,My child wants to use Roblox but I don’t know anything about it. Is it safe? Are there ways to make it safer?,AAP,"Roblox is technically not a game itself but a platform or application full of different games that developers have created. You download the Roblox application to your device and once you are in you can play any game that piques your interest. Anyone in the world who is on Roblox can create a game, so there are millions of different games on the Roblox platform ranging from racing games, obstacle courses, food creation to roleplaying, shooting or horror games. Many people worry about the safety of Roblox. When you give people the freedom to create any game they wish, some people may use that power to create inappropriate or toxic games.  

Roblox also relies on in-game currency called “Robux,” which players buy with real money. Robux are used to purchase in-game items like clothes for avatars, weapons, cars, pets or “VIP” upgrade experiences. Many children who play Roblox don’t fully understand the value of money yet, so it’s important to not give them open access to your credit card. Roblox players also commonly like to trade in-game items, and some children have reported feeling pressure from other players to trade or give away their stuff. Disabling the chat can help prevent this. 

Roblox's parental controls settings include the ability to disable or restrict chat (chat with everyone, just friends, or no one) and set an account 4-digit PIN that needs to be entered to make any changes to the account. Parent controls also enable account restrictions that aim to filter out inappropriate games. 

As a parent, be involved in what your child plays on Roblox, including: 

Watch along to learn what kinds of games they like and why 
If you think a game is too violent or inappropriate, use parental controls to block it 
If your child wants to spend Robux, teach them about what Robux mean in dollars. Have them earn an allowance and spend their own money on Robux. 
Talk to your child about who tries to “friend” them in the game and how to block people who are rude, aggressive, or being inappropriate. 
For more information on why it is easy for kids to spend hours on Roblox, please see our previous post.

GAMING,Why are Roblox and YouTube so easy to use for hours on end?,AAP,"There’s not much research published about YouTube (see a related post for a summary), but it’s well-known that the recommended video feed and auto-play features make it easy to spend hours continuously watching YouTube videos.  

We couldn’t find any research about Roblox! However, we know the Roblox platform well, and it’s important for caregivers to know: 

It allows developers to create their own games and post them for anyone to play. So, the quality of the games can be really variable – some interesting, some terrible. Roblox has settings to limit which types of games kids can play and who they can interact with. 
There are millions of games to choose from, from role playing to driving to shooter games. Many games require kids to play longer to earn more in-game “currency” that lets them buy and collect in-game items. When they get bored with one game, they can easily find others to try.  
Kids’ friends may be on Roblox, which motivates them to stay on and interact with them.  
The combination of 1) friends being on Roblox, 2) all the in-game rewards, and 3) endless game options might make it hard for kids to transition off of Roblox and do other things.  

Our advice for helping children build interests in other activities include: 

Have your child plan out how long they are going to play, which Roblox games they’ll play, and how they want to be reminded to stop (e.g., with a timer, a reminding them, stopping by themself).  
Then, plan for an activity that they have chosen right after stopping Roblox. This might be baking, playing with a pet or doing something low stress and fun – so there’s less resistance to transitioning.   
But to be realistic, transitions might be difficult – Research with young kids shows that even when kids set a plan, it’s harder to transition off when the platform keeps recommending new videos or games. If your child is arguing about stopping playing Roblox, it would also be fine to have them take a break from it for a week or so.  https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/adolescents/early-adolescence-questions/navigating-online-and-social-media-relationships-with-patients/",https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/early-childhood-questions/early-childhood-questions/using-roblox-and-youtube-for-extended-periods-of-time/
GAMING,What Are Some Basic Gaming and Social Media Rules for Elementary Schoolers?,Common Sense,"Young kids may not be on social media yet, but at this age, they start to interact with others in online worlds. Such video games, apps, and websites (like Animal Crossing or Minecraft) are closed environments where kids can explore, meet friends, and let their imaginations run free.

One challenge for parents and caregivers is helping kids balance time spent playing in these online worlds -- which can draw them in for long periods -- and time spent offline. And, even though online worlds have rules about behavior, some kids find ways around them. It's important to talk with children when you first introduce these games about how to avoid and respond to harmful behavior.

Kids younger than 6 probably shouldn't play in virtual worlds. If your kids can't yet read or write, they'll be frustrated in online worlds. Instead, look for preschool games that were designed for children this age.

Set up accounts together. By creating usernames and passwords together, you can walk your kids through the basics of safe and appropriate online behavior.

Make sure your children never share their passwords. Kids often give other children their passwords for help in a game. Explain that giving away a password is not safe and can be harmful for your child.

If you wouldn't let your children have unsupervised play dates, don't let them go online by themselves. Remember, the social skills they bring to online worlds are the same ones they have (or don't have) in real life.

Keep the devices in a central place. This lets you or other family members guide your child as they play online.

Review the apps and sites yourself. Make sure you check out apps and sites before you let your kids use them. Don't settle for the most popular apps, games, and sites. Look around for ones that appeal to your kid's interests or have an educational angle.

Set time limits. Make sure online play is balanced with offline play and other activities that are good for your kid's physical, emotional, and mental health.

Talk about how to behave online. Teach your kids a good rule of thumb: If they wouldn't say something to someone's face, they shouldn't say it online.

Show kids how to report misbehavior. If kids ever see something that makes them feel uncomfortable, upset, sad, or worried, let them know they should tell you or a trusted adult. Show your kids how to report inappropriate content or block other users. Explain that this is a healthy way to keep games and apps safe and fun for everyone.

Talk about money and what it means to your family. Some sites rely on users to buy extras. Explain your family values around spending money online. Be clear about what you expect your child to do when they come across an in-game purchase.   https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-are-some-basic-gaming-and-social-media-rules-for-elementary-schoolers",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-are-some-basic-gaming-and-social-media-rules-for-elementary-schoolers
GAMING,Why does my teen like to watch people play games on YouTube?,Common Sense,"At any one time, there are thousands of gamers broadcasting themselves playing games on the main YouTube channel as well as on YouTube Gaming. Gamers can live-stream themselves narrating their way through games, post videos of Let's Plays (recordings of them playing games), and much, much more. It may not make much sense to parents, but live-streaming and Let's Plays attract serious fans. Enthusiasts gather to watch, chat, pick up tips, and enjoy the game -- not unlike other spectator sports.

Even though it seems like a solitary activity, watching others play the games you love is a form of social interaction. The top players are celebrities in the gaming world, and they draw huge audiences. But while YouTube has age-appropriate games such as Minecraft and Mario Kart, it features tons of violent video games, including Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, and more. And it's not just the games themselves that can be mature. The broadcasters and comments are totally unfiltered and frequently littered with hate speech, homophobia, sexism, and other derogatory talk. YouTube's Restricted Mode setting will block some of the edgy stuff, but not all.

If your teen likes to watch gamers on YouTube, it may be hard to restrict. You can try these tips for limiting YouTube content [[link to Q above]]. While lots of YouTube gamers are perfectly fine for kids, it's a good idea to check in and see who and what they're watching. You also want to help your kid manage their viewing time, as these videos can run upward of 30 minutes. Check the game reviews on Common Sense Media to find conversation-starter ideas for the games your teen likes. Here are some ideas to connect with teens over their interest in YouTube gamers.

Ask who their favorite players are and why. You might be surprised that your teen likes certain gamers because of the worldly wisdom they impart while they're playing. Just showing an interest in your teen's world helps strengthen your bond and gives you an in for conversation.

Talk about the games. Video games can be incredibly complex. The gamers who play the titles your teen likes reveal new and unique aspects of games that your kid didn't know about -- and which they can use when they play. Help them identify these takeaways -- they might lead to other interests or topics of discussion.

Counter negative messages. The video-gaming world can be very aggressive. There's swearing, sexist and racist comments, and more. Don't let your teen get away with adopting these attitudes. Keep reinforcing messages such as the importance of treating all people with respect.

Steer them toward the good stuff. Even ultra-violent video games have less violent alternatives. If your kid is getting into games that you think are too mature, help them find more appropriate ones to play.

Talk about different kinds of games. Discuss the differences between educational games, other games, and videos. Why is one type more beneficial? How can kids tell the difference between a site with games that offer some learning potential and games that are meant for adults?

Discuss good sportsmanship. Users can watch live feeds on the site and comment on what they're seeing.

GAMING,Is it safe for my kid to watch Minecraft videos on YouTube?,Common Sense,"Since Minecraft is a game that appeals to many ages -- and has infinite possibilities -- not all YouTube videos will be age-appropriate. The unique features of the game, including the ability for any player to create anything they want, can result in wide variations in quality, age-appropriateness, and relevance to your kid's specific interests and gaming ability. If your kid is just starting out, it's a good idea to sit with them and help them find quality videos that teach Minecraft basics. After they get some familiarity with the better Minecraft channels, you can loosen the reins. But check in, too, because a lot of Minecraft YouTubers also play more mature games (and even mature versions of Minecraft).

There are hundreds of channels devoted to Minecraft, including popular but edgy ones such as Yogscast and SkyDoesMinecraft, and it's hard to know which ones are good for kids. Although you could download an app such as Enderflix Kids, which curates only kid-friendly Minecraft videos, you know your little fanatic will be begging -- and searching YouTube -- for more. Our curated list of kid-friendly Minecraft videos on YouTube is an excellent starting point for young players.

On YouTube, even kid-friendly videos come with a few caveats. First, with many clocking in at 20 or 30 minutes, they can be a major time suck. Second, many have commercials that advertise products ranging from cars to cookies to vodka. Third, some videos contain salty language, so it's best to preview videos when possible.

GAMING,What should parents know about Twitch?,Common Sense,"For non-gamers, the idea of watching other people play video games like Fortnite or Call of Duty doesn't make much sense. But, each month, more than 100 million people log on to Twitch to do just that. This game-enthusiast site specializes in live-streaming video broadcasts of gamers fighting, solving puzzles, and strategizing -- all while making colorful commentary. Twitch, owned by Amazon, also features gaming news, product announcements, events, and a vocal community of fans who really love games.

Here's how it works: Hundreds of games are listed in the main directory. Click on one you like to discover dozens of live videos of people playing the game. You can follow your favorite broadcasters for free or subscribe to their channel for an additional fee. You can also become a broadcaster yourself. The broadcasters -- who are from all over the world -- earn money from subscriptions.

While Twitch is a gamer's paradise, and the overall tone is kept in line by the site's usage rules, there's plenty of age-inappropriate content. Here's more you need to know about Twitch:

Most of the games are pretty violent. While Twitch has milder games such as Minecraft, many are mature, including Fallout and Call of Duty.
Many of the commentators use mature language. Twitch has rules against getting too graphic, but kids will definitely hear and see swear words.
The site runs a lot of advertising. You'll see mature movie and game ads as well as fast-food commercials. (A Turbo account eliminates ads.)
Twitch can be a real time-waster. If you're concerned about the amount of time your kid already spends playing video games, you'll want to rein in the Twitch time, as there's an endless supply of gamers, information, and other game-buff stuff.
Live-streaming is risky. There's no time delay with live-streaming -- what gamers say and do goes out immediately, so the content is unpredictable.
Twitch costs can add up. You can watch for free or sign up for a free account with features such as chatting. A Turbo account eliminates ads and costs $8.99 per month. Each subscription to an individual broadcaster costs money. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-parents-know-about-twitch",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-should-parents-know-about-twitch
GAMING,Could My Child Be Addicted to Video Games?,Common Sense,"The word ""addiction"" gets used a lot to describe a certain kind of focused attention on screens and tech. We say we're ""addicted"" to our phones or ""addicted"" to watching our favorite show. But research shows that 8- to 18-year-olds also use video games and other forms of tech to stay connected with family and friends.

If you have concerns about your child's behavior, you may want to talk with a pediatrician. They can look into what might be causing problems, whether it's game addiction or another issue, like depression. Try to pay attention to whether gaming affects your child's mood, grades, or how they interact with others.

Also consider how much time you spend looking at screens. Make sure you're setting a good example at home. Try to model how long to use devices and when to put them away. And it's always a good idea to encourage your child to do something offline. This includes exercising, spending time outside, and socializing with others. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/could-my-child-be-addicted-to-video-games",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/could-my-child-be-addicted-to-video-games
GAMING,"What are massively multiplayer online games, or MMOs, and are they safe for my kid?",Common Sense,"Multiplayer games (technically called ""massively multiplayer online games,"" or MMOGs, or MMOs) let kids play against their friends and other people they meet on a game's network. Some popular examples are World of Warcraft and Dungeons and Dragons Online. Most of these games allow for instant messaging and conversation through headsets and can be great opportunities for teamwork and group problem solving.

The main things to keep an eye on are interactions with strangers, which can be part of the fun but also a potential risk; harassment from other players, which can take the form of bullying or even sexual harassment; and, finally, the amount of time these games require. It can be helpful to discuss each of these issues and talk about balancing gaming time with other activities before your kid starts playing MMOs.

You might want to take a look at the privacy settings the site offers, and talk to your kids about responsible online communication, including not sharing personal information.

GAMING,"Should I let my kid play Minecraft, Fortnite, or Grand Theft Auto?",Common Sense,"What the heck happened? Yesterday your kid was content playing Legos under your watchful eye, and today all they want to do is kill virtual bad guys. Take it from us: this is normal. And once you brush up on the games they're begging to play, you'll know exactly how to manage each one's biggest concerns, from chatting with strangers to exposure to violence. The good news is research shows there are actually a bunch of benefits to gaming. Here we walk you through the ins and outs of the three most popular games that kids love (and that send shivers down your spine) so you can make your own decisions about what games to bring into your home.

Minecraft
Minecraft, of course, is the hugely popular sandbox-style game that lets players create whatever they like—from buildings to tools to mazes. Kids never have to interact with others in Minecraft; they can just build to their heart's content. Or they can join a ""server,"" where they can either share their designs with the world or play with others to blend worlds together, building, fighting, collaborating, and chit-chatting.

What you need to know
It's on every platform. There are versions for consoles, PCs, and mobile. Some schools use the ""edu"" version to teach STEM and collaboration skills.
Anyone can play it. Several modes and levels of difficulty allow everyone from total beginners to pros.
Solo and multiplayer modes are totally different. Playing solo can be almost meditative, while the multiplayer version can lead to riotous mayhem.
The branding is off the charts. Kids will encounter Minecraft YouTube channels, books, fan sites, clothing, and more that will tempt them and may or may not be age appropriate.
If you let your kid play Minecraft
Start small. The single-player, Creative mode can be a total joy—but also a time-suck. Set time limits and spend some time playing along with your kid, and you're golden.

Build up to baddies. Survival mode adds dangers like zombies or squids who can hurt or kill their characters. Save this mode for older kids and keep very young or sensitive kids in Creative mode.

Master multiplayer. Playing with friends on the same console or side-by-side on laptops encourages collaboration, communication, and lots of laughter. But public servers—where players enter worlds with large groups of strangers—can vary a lot.

Research the best Minecraft servers for kids (there are scores of websites that catalog them). Test out the best candidates to understand the vibe.
Have kids ask friends for reputable servers to join.
Host your own server (search online for instructions) to create a friends-only world.
Minecraft has a reputation of having dedicated moderators who work to keep things positive.
Peek over your kid's shoulder at the messages scrolling through the game (with no private messaging, things shouldn't get too shady).
Fortnite
Fortnite: Battle Royale is a last-one-standing game that kids can play in brief sessions (over and over and over again). You start out battling up to 100 other live players in solo mode, pairs, or teams. The game's creative marketing—with new ""seasons,"" costumes, dances, and weapons—keeps players coming back.

What you need to know
First, the concerns: Fortnite has guns, killing, and the possibility of voice chat with strangers. Plus, it can cost real money, as kids want to get all the cool add-ons. In the world of shooter games, though, Fortnite is pretty tame. Graphics are cartoonish, kills are bloodless and corpseless, and there's a light-hearted tone to the game thanks to silly elements throughout.

If you let your kid play Fortnite
Discuss violence. Every parent feels differently about media violence. Fortnite's focus on guns and ammo may be a deal-breaker for you. But others might think the quick-thinking and strategizing Fortnite relies on can safely mimic adolescent risk-taking. Whatever your philosophy, helping your kid understand how you feel about media violence will build your kid's media literacy skills and help them understand your family's values. Try asking: ""After you see violence on-screen, do you ever replay it in your mind later? What's the like for you?"" Or, ""How do you think you'd react if you saw someone on the street wielding a real gun?""

Set rules about chat. Kids can play solo, with friends, or with strangers. If they're playing with others, they can talk to each other with a mic. Chatting helps teammates coordinate on strategy and practice communication skills, but if your kid is talking to strangers, there are lots of unknowns. Fortnite offers different chat settings, so you can restrict gameplay to friends only, allow them to game with anyone but chat only with friends, or allow all chat—but stick around so you can hear what's going on (and mute anyone who is annoying or offensive).

Set limits on time and money. You can't ""pause"" Fortnite, but you can tell your kid they can play a certain number of sessions or for a specific amount of time. Be aware that Fortnite charges for cool costumes (skins) and funny dances (emotes). Decide ahead of time if you'll let them spend your money or their allowance on V-bucks.

Grand Theft Auto
GTA is a series of games where players assume the roles of hardened criminals (thieves, gangsters) and basically kill, steal, molest women, and sell drugs for points. (Seriously, you can't make this stuff up.) If your kid's an avid gamer, at some point he'll likely want to try his luck at GTA or another popular M-rated title such as Call of Duty. As games go, these are well-made—but they're pretty gnarly.

What you need to know
We rate all GTA games for 18 and up because mature content and mixed messages abound: Killing other players earns your character money, and having sex with prostitutes offers health points (???). Language is also an issue—both from in-game characters and through voice chat with other players. Some versions of GTA have mini-games or cutscenes that include sex, drugs, or violence.

If you let your kid play Grand Theft Auto
Consider playing together. You might be wondering how we could recommend playing this game at all after the description above. But the truth is, your relationship with your kid is more valuable than any media message. And if you and your teen bond over playing games together—even edgy ones like this—it can be a net positive. Even if you have zero interest in the game, if you've OK'd this game, at least sit down and watch sometimes—it can give you insight into your kid's thinking and offer opportunities to insert your own thoughts (just try to avoid judging unless you want to be shut out). Ask: ""Do you think there's a larger message in this game?"" Or, ""If you were going to write an essay about this game for school, what would you write?"" You could also make this game off limits unless it's played with an adult.

Talk about the impact of fantasy violence. As kids get older, they're better able to distinguish between real and fantasy violence and are also getting better at connecting their actions with their emotions. It can be enlightening to discuss your kid's reactions to playing a game like GTA. They may have some perspectives you hadn't considered. But the key to getting to the truth is to approach the conversation with curiosity and not judgment. Ask: ""Do you feel a physical rush when playing?"" ""Do you ever imagine what these scenarios would be like in real life?"" ""How do you usually feel after you stop playing?""

Counterbalance with positive media. Look at your kid's overall media diet and make sure to fit some social-responsibility content into the mix. Do a family movie night featuring stories of young people making a difference in the world. Make sure to watch, read, or play narratives that bust stereotypes. And take a peek into lives affected by real violence to make sure they really understand its impact. And if none of these games make your list of approved picks, know that you can always have tons of fun with all-ages stuff like Mario Kart, Dance Dance Revolution, NBA 2K, and more. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-let-my-kid-play-minecraft-fortnite-or-grand-theft-auto",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-let-my-kid-play-minecraft-fortnite-or-grand-theft-auto
GAMING,How Much Gaming is Too Much?,Ask Lisa,"In the ""Ask Lisa Podcast"" episode titled ""Encore: How Much Gaming is Too Much?"", Dr. Lisa Damour addresses concerns about excessive gaming among children. Here are her insights and recommendations from the episode:
Evaluate Functioning Across Settings: Dr. Damour highlights the importance of assessing how the child is performing in various aspects of life, such as schoolwork, extracurricular activities, and social interactions. If a child is maintaining good grades, participating in sports or other hobbies, and generally seems well-adjusted, these are positive indicators of overall well-being despite the time spent gaming.
Understand Gaming and Social Development: The concern that gaming might impede social development is valid, particularly if a child opts to game alone frequently while peers are socializing in person. Parents should observe whether gaming is replacing other developmental activities or inhibiting social skills.
Recognize Signs of Potential Gaming Addiction: Addiction is characterized by compulsive use and an inability to stop, which might manifest as significant distress or disruption when gaming is interrupted. If gaming significantly interferes with daily responsibilities or social interactions, this could be a concern.
Consult Educators and Professionals: Teachers can provide valuable insights into a child's social interactions and behavior in school. Consulting with educators can help parents gauge whether their child's gaming is affecting other areas of development.
Encourage Variety and Balance: Dr. Damour advocates for a balanced approach where children are encouraged to engage in a variety of activities. This helps in developing diverse skills and prevents any single activity from dominating their time and attention.
Set Clear Guidelines and Boundaries: Establishing rules about gaming times and the types of games played can help manage a child's gaming habits. It's important to discuss these guidelines with the child to ensure they understand and agree with the rationale.
Monitor and Discuss Game Content: Understanding the content and environment of the games played is crucial. Parents should be aware of the social norms within gaming environments and discuss inappropriate or harmful content with their children.
Foster Open Communication: Encouraging open dialogue about gaming and its effects can help children develop critical thinking about their hobbies and choices. This includes discussing how gaming makes them feel and whether it fulfills or detracts from their well-being.
Dr. Damour emphasizes that while gaming itself is not inherently harmful and can develop certain cognitive skills, it's the lack of balance and potential for neglecting other developmental areas that can pose risks. Parents should focus on moderation, guidance, and open communication to ensure that gaming remains a healthy part of their children's lives. https://drlisadamour.com/resource/encore-how-much-gaming-is-too-much/",https://drlisadamour.com/resource/encore-how-much-gaming-is-too-much/
GAMING,Should My Kid Play Violent Video Games?,Ask Lisa,"In the ""Ask Lisa Podcast"" episode titled ""Should My Kid Play Violent Video Games?"", Dr. Lisa Damour provides detailed guidance for parents concerned about the impact of violent video games on their children. Here are her recommendations laid out as actionable steps for parents:

Assess Behavior Changes: Monitor your child’s behavior for increases in aggression that correspond with playing violent video games. If negative behaviors escalate, consider pulling back on game time.
Set Clear Boundaries: Establish and enforce strict rules regarding which video games are allowed and under what circumstances they can be played.
Engage in Discussions: Regularly talk with your child about the content of the games they play. Watch them play and discuss what happens in the game to help them differentiate between game scenarios and real-life behavior.
Understand Game Norms: Be aware of the 'norms' within video games, such as aggression and how they could potentially desensitize children to violence.
Consider Age Appropriateness: Take into account your child’s age and maturity level when deciding whether to allow them to play violent video games. Older children may be better equipped to handle disturbing content.
Encourage Diverse Activities: Promote a balanced lifestyle by encouraging your child to engage in various types of activities beyond video gaming.
Keep Communication Open: Maintain open lines of communication with your child about video gaming. Explain your concerns and listen to their perspective to foster understanding.
Negotiate Gaming Limits: Set realistic gaming limits. For instance, you might allow your child to finish a gaming round but not start a new one close to the end of their allowed time.
By following these steps, parents can more effectively manage their children's interaction with violent video games, helping them understand the impact of these games while balancing their social interactions and personal development.

GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Can Online Socializing Go Too Far?,Ask Lisa,"n the ""Ask Lisa Podcast,"" Episode 18 titled ""Can Online Socializing Go Too Far?"" Lisa and Reena discuss the complexities and concerns around teenagers’ use of digital technologies for socializing, especially considering the limitations imposed by the pandemic. Here’s a summary of the advice and discussion:

Context and Concerns:

A parent is concerned about her 14-year-old daughter being on her phone almost constantly, up until late at night, although she maintains good grades and communication with her parents.
Key Points from the Discussion:

Assessment of the Situation:
Despite the extensive use of the phone, the teenager maintains good academic performance and a positive attitude, which makes setting strict limitations challenging for the parent.
Impact on Sleep:
Lisa emphasizes the importance of sleep and advises that phone usage should not interfere with it. The girl's reversed sleep schedule (staying up late and waking at noon) seems to accommodate adequate sleep, reducing immediate concerns about sleep deprivation.
Social Necessities:
Given the social restrictions due to the pandemic, digital socializing has become a vital link for teenagers to maintain social interactions. Lisa suggests that under current conditions, it's reasonable to allow more flexibility in screen time as it supports necessary social connections.
Setting Boundaries:
Even though the teenager is using the phone responsibly, Lisa discusses the importance of setting boundaries to ensure that the phone use is healthy and does not replace all other activities. Teenagers should still engage in physical activities, help around the house, and have varied interests beyond the screen.
Monitoring and Dialogue:
Continuous dialogue about online activities is crucial. Parents should discuss what is seen and done online to ensure it remains appropriate. If a teenager’s judgment online is questionable, stricter monitoring and more active guidance might be necessary.
Evaluating Online Interactions:
It’s important for parents to understand the nature of their children’s online interactions and to distinguish between harmless socializing and potentially harmful communications.
Reflection on Digital Usage:
Encourage teenagers to reflect on their online time: Does it make them feel better or worse? Is it interfering with their responsibilities or emotional well-being?
Conclusion and Advice:
The main takeaway from the podcast is that while online socializing is critical for maintaining social interactions, especially during restrictive times like the pandemic, it is also essential to maintain a balance. Parents should ensure that their children are engaging in healthy activities outside of their digital interactions and that their sleep and other daily functions are not being compromised. Dialogue about the use and impact of technology is crucial, and setting appropriate boundaries, while sometimes challenging, is necessary for healthy development. https://drlisadamour.com/resource/can-online-socializing-go-too-far/",https://drlisadamour.com/resource/can-online-socializing-go-too-far/
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,How and When Do I Give My Kid a Phone?,Ask Lisa,"""Ask Lisa Podcast,"" Episode 130 titled ""How and When Do I Give My Kid a Phone?"" the discussion revolves around the appropriate age for children to have their own cellphones, the implications of cellphone use, and setting up rules for usage. Here’s a summary of the discussion and advice given by Lisa:
Context and Concerns:
A parent is contemplating whether to give her nearly 13-year-old daughter a cellphone. The concern is about the child's ability to manage the potential distraction and the social repercussions of not having a phone when most peers do.
Key Points from the Discussion:
Appropriate Age for a Cellphone:
There isn't a specific ""right"" age universally applicable to all kids. The decision often hinges on the child's maturity level, the family's values, and the child’s social environment.
The transition period from elementary to middle school is commonly when children start asking for phones. This time often aligns with increasing social needs and activities.
Challenges and Concerns:
Cellphones can significantly affect dopamine regulation, potentially leading to addictive behaviors towards digital technology.
Social exclusion is a valid concern if most peers communicate digitally and make plans online, potentially isolating a child without a phone.
Strategic Approach to Introducing Cellphones:
Delay the introduction as long as possible while ensuring the child does not feel socially isolated.
Introduce a phone with stringent rules and parental controls to manage its use responsibly.
Rules and Parental Controls:
Set strict guidelines about phone usage, including no phones in the bedroom, phones must be charged in a common area, and limits on app installations.
Utilize parental control apps and settings to monitor usage and control access to content.
Discuss and agree upon these rules before handing over the phone. A formal agreement or contract can be helpful.
Monitoring and Adjustments:
Regularly review phone usage and adjust rules as necessary based on the child's behavior and responsibility levels.
Be prepared to modify the rules for different children within the same family, based on each child’s behavior and needs.
Promoting Healthy Digital Habits:
Teach children that phones are tools, not toys, and should be used for constructive purposes.
Encourage open communication about what they encounter online, including uncomfortable or inappropriate content.
Conclusion and Advice: Dr. Lisa emphasizes the importance of balancing a child’s social integration with healthy digital habits. She advises parents to use the leverage they have when children are eager to get their phones to set up strict initial rules, which can be relaxed responsibly over time as children demonstrate their ability to handle the technology wisely. The ultimate goal is to help children develop a healthy relationship with digital technology, reflecting the rules adults should follow themselves.

GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Is the internet making my kid socially isolated?,Common Sense,"For some kids who are shy, not very secure socially, or simply interested in a topic their real-world friends aren't into, the online world can be a lifesaver. Some kids feel emboldened to experiment creatively, meet new people, pursue their interests, and try new things in a way they wouldn't feel comfortable doing in person. Your kid also may just be going through a phase or may not talk about his or her ""real"" friends.

But, if your kids are unable to make friends at school or through groups, if they can only find happiness online, and if they pursue the online world to the exclusion of in-person relationships and experiences, you might need to intervene. Even though today's kids socialize a lot online, they actually prefer face-to-face interactions. Consider whether these issues point to underlying issues that may have nothing to do with being online but might be signs of depression, being bullied, or other offline issues, and, of course, seek outside help if necessary. Also be aware that kids whose social lives revolve around the online world can be led into risky situations. Make sure your online-oriented kid understands that people can misrepresent themselves online, and that they should never give money, photos, or personal information to or meet anyone that they've only had contact with online. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-the-internet-making-my-kid-socially-isolated",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-the-internet-making-my-kid-socially-isolated
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Is there a downside to keeping my kid off social sites?,Common Sense,"In most cases, no. Kids who are exposed to a variety of experiences through home and school, including digital ones, likely will pick up the technical skills they need to interact socially online whenever the time is right.

However, kids may pay a social price within their circle of friends if they're not part of the online world. Kids' online worlds and their ""real"" worlds are porous. Being in the know about the virtual world means they're part of the group in the ""real world."" Often kids will plan to meet up online after school. They talk about the games they're playing and may even enact them on the playground. In some schools, there's a certain status attained by being in a particular online world with other kids.

Your kids may not be the only ones whose parents keep them off social sites, but if the groups of friends they want to hang with are all on, they may not feel as involved. Only you can determine how important this is to your kids and how not being on social sites affects them. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-there-a-downside-to-keeping-my-kid-off-social-sites",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-there-a-downside-to-keeping-my-kid-off-social-sites
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Will Social Media Harm My Kid?,Ask Lisa,"""Will social media harm my kid?"""" Dr. Lisa Damour provides a nuanced view on managing children’s social media use effectively. Here are her key suggestions:

Delay Social Media Introduction: Dr. Damour recommends delaying the introduction of social media until children are at least 14 years old. She notes that around this age, children develop a neurological capacity for skepticism, which is crucial for critically assessing and understanding the content they encounter online.
Understand Gender Differences: She points out that the impact of social media can vary significantly between genders. While much research has focused on girls and body image issues, boys also face serious challenges on these platforms, including exposure to toxic masculinity, fitness pressures, and various forms of bigotry.
Balance Social Needs and Safety: Dr. Damour emphasizes the importance of balancing the protective measures against potential harms of social media with the need to prevent social isolation. She suggests that social media should primarily be used to maintain real-life friendships, particularly during critical developmental phases like adolescence.
Set Clear Boundaries: To mitigate potential harms, Dr. Damour advises setting strict boundaries for social media use. This includes no phones in the bedroom to protect sleep, limiting access to a small number of necessary platforms, and setting clear rules about appropriate content and interactions.
Maintain Open Communication: Regular discussions about online experiences and the content encountered on social media are essential. Dr. Damour encourages parents to engage in ongoing dialogues that help children reflect on what they see online and understand the broader implications of their digital engagements.
Dr. Damour’s approach is aimed at ensuring that while children can benefit from the social connections that social media facilitates, they are also shielded from its potential downsides through strategic parental guidance and open communication.

GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,What is too much social media use?,APA,"Spending many hours online engaged in healthy behavior, such as talking honestly with friends or learning from credible sources, may not be all bad. But about 50% of teens report at least one sign of problematic social media use including:

An inability to stop even when they want to
Social media use interfering with their daily routines
Going out of one’s way or lying to maintain social media use
Problems with schoolwork or relationships because of social media use
Help teens be aware of these signs of problematic social media use and help them reduce their time online if needed.",https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/social-media-literacy-teens
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Why young brains are especially vulnerable to social media?,APA,"Starting around age 10, children’s brains undergo a fundamental shift that spurs them to seek social rewards, including attention and approval from their peers.

At the same time, we hand them smartphones (Kids & Tech, Influence Central, 2018).

Social media platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Snapchat have provided crucial opportunities for interaction that are a normal part of development—especially during a time of severe isolation prompted by the pandemic. But they’ve also been increasingly linked to mental health problems, including anxiety, depressive symptoms, and body image concerns.

So, why do kids face a higher risk of harm on social media?

Let’s dig deeper.

[Related: Potential risks of content, features, and functions: The science of how social media affects youth]

Social rewards and the brain
Between the ages of 10 and 12, changes in the brain make social rewards—compliments on a new hairstyle, laughter from a classmate—start to feel a lot more satisfying. Specifically, receptors for the “happy hormones” oxytocin and dopamine multiply in a part of the brain called the ventral striatum, making preteens extra sensitive to attention and admiration from others.

[Related: What neuroscience tells us about the teenage brain]

“We know that social media activity is closely tied to the ventral striatum,” said Mitch Prinstein, APA’s chief science officer. “This region gets a dopamine and oxytocin rush whenever we experience social rewards.”

Right next door to the ventral striatum lies the ventral pallidum, a region of the brain key for motivating action. These structures, which lie beneath the more recently evolved cortex, are older parts of the brain that drive instinctual behaviors.

In adulthood, social media use is also linked to activation in the brain’s reward centers, but two key differences may lessen harm, Prinstein said. First, adults tend to have a fixed sense of self that relies less on feedback from peers. Second, adults have a more mature prefrontal cortex, an area that can help regulate emotional responses to social rewards.


Permanent and public
In youth, the drive for approval has historically helped kids and teens develop healthy social skills and connections. But arriving at school in a new pair of designer jeans, hoping your crush will smile at you in the hallway, is worlds away from posting a video on TikTok that may get thousands of views and likes, Prinstein said.

Part of what makes online interactions so different from in-person ones is their permanent—and often public—nature, according to research by Jacqueline Nesi, PhD, an assistant professor of psychology at Brown University (Psychological Inquiry, Vol. 21, No. 3, 2020).

“After you walk away from a regular conversation, you don’t know if the other person liked it, or if anyone else liked it—and it’s over,” Prinstein said. “That’s not true on social media.”

Instead, kids, their friends, and even people they’ve never met can continue to seek, deliver, or withhold social rewards in the form of likes, comments, views, and follows.

As children and teens increasingly go online for entertainment and connection, parents, scholars, and policymakers are concerned that young people’s biology is making them particularly vulnerable to—and in some cases, even exploited by—social media.

Protecting young users
Further research shows how this biological vulnerability plays out in the lives of children and teens. Younger social media users are more likely than older ones to have body image issues, while kids who use Instagram or Snapchat before age 11 face a higher risk of online harassment (Saiphoo, A. N., & Vahedi, Z., Computers in Human Behavior, Vol. 101, 2019; Charmaraman, L., et al., Computers in Human Behavior, Vol. 127, 2022).

These and other findings have prompted recommendations from the U.S. Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, MD, that social media and other technology companies help minimize fallout from their products, including by prioritizing the wellbeing of young users and by sharing their data with independent researchers (Protecting youth mental health (PDF, 1.01MB), The U.S. Surgeon General’s Advisory, 2021).

“It’s time we stopped trying to make a profit on kids’ developing brains,” Prinstein said. “For the first time in human history, we have given up autonomous control over our social relationships and interactions, and we now allow machine learning and artificial intelligence to make decisions for us.”

“We have already seen how this has created tremendous vulnerabilities to our way of life. It’s even scarier to consider how this may be changing brain development for an entire generation of youth,” he said.",https://www.apa.org/news/apa/2022/social-media-children-teens
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Is it OK for my kid to join an online playground like Animal Jam?,Common Sense,"Online playgrounds like Animal Jam are digital environments where kids can create an avatar, explore three-dimensional scenes, complete fun tasks, and interact with others. They're popular with kids in elementary school because they offer built-in safety features including things like age-verification for members, filtered chat, and human monitors that protect kids who aren't yet ready for multiplayer games and social media.

Whether it's an app or a website, an online playground can be a good way to allow young kids to explore new environments and learn responsible online behavior. But there are some things to be mindful of, including interaction with other players, costs, screen limits, and social dynamics if your kid joins a world with friends from school. To make sure your kid stays safe and has fun, you should stay involved. Here are some signs to look for to make sure a virtual world is OK for your kid:
Chat is pre-set or ""canned."" Kids select phrases from a list rather than free-typing. Inappropriate words are blocked.
Limited exposure to advertising. Sites that charge a subscription fee probably won't run ads -- although they will have promotions and campaigns to encourage kids to come back. Some branded sites will have fun activities but also will be promoting their products.
Human monitors. High-quality sites employ real human monitors who oversee the players.
Reports. Some sites will send you a report of your child's activities. If it's an educational site, the report may include an evaluation of your child's skills.
Responsive customer service. You want to get a quick response if anything goes wrong, you need to cancel, or you just want to give the site some feedback. Read online reviews by other parents to learn more about a company's customer service.
Age-appropriate learning and social games. Before you register your kid, spend some time interacting on the site yourself or with your kid. Do you like the games? Does your kid like them? Are the activities engaging? Does the website update the games to keep them fresh?
Cooperative play. Some virtual worlds design games wherein kids have to work together to make progress.
Neutral avatar designs. Make sure your kid can design characters that are every color of the rainbow and don't have stereotypical male or female traits. (Pink sneakers are OK, but pink stilettos? Um, no.)
Manageable costs. Virtual worlds support themselves using various fee models. Some charge a subscription and allow users to earn in-game currency to pay for items, such as (virtual) furnishings for their (virtual) apartments, in the game. Some virtual worlds are free to use but rely on in-app purchases for their revenue. Make sure you know how the virtual operates and discuss how much you're willing to pay for it. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-ok-for-my-kid-to-join-an-online-playground-like-animal-jam",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-ok-for-my-kid-to-join-an-online-playground-like-animal-jam
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Should I let my kid get social media like Instagram or Snapchat before they're 13?,Common Sense,"Have your kids asked for social media yet? Did you tell them you'd think it over (and hope they'd forget about it until college)? Figuring out whether to allow tweens to use social media—and under what conditions—is one of those fun, new problems only we lucky parents of ""digital natives"" have to worry about. It forces you to think about issues like your kid's maturity level, mental health, and ability to navigate the risks of the online world, not to mention the judgy-ness of other parents if you say yes. There's also the fuzzy legal issue of allowing kids under 13 to get a social media account. Like so much of parenting in these crazy times, there's no right answer for everyone. But there is a right answer for you—and we'll help you find it.

Quick take

Thirteen is an arbitrary age. The age 13 rule was never intended to keep young kids safe online. It's the ""age of consent"" for data tracking, according to the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).
Plenty of good reasons to wait. Kids' social, emotional, and cognitive skills really benefit from an extra few years of maturity.
But, it's not wrong to say ""yes"" early. Some young kids do well with online socializing—especially with guidance—and they can suffer socially if all their friends are on it.
Do it safely. Whenever you decide your kid is ready, enable strict privacy settings, spot-check their accounts, and check in frequently to make sure their interactions are positive.
Don't you have to be 13 to have social media?

Let's clear something up: The age 13 rule isn't about online safety. And you or your kid won't get in trouble if you don't follow it. Thirteen is the age kids can consent to having their data tracked, as set forth in the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). And with 50% of kids 12 and under on social media, obviously the rule is easy to sidestep. The extra time to mature helps kids grow in a few critical areas that are essential to navigating the information-rich, unpredictable, and drama-heavy social media world.

Why we rate most popular social media apps in the 15 to 16 age range

Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok—the concerns are all slightly different. For some apps, it's the kind of content kids can encounter, while others might enable easy contact with strangers. You can read each review for details before saying yes or no, but here are the developmental issues to consider:

Critical thinking. Younger kids don't yet have the skills to reliably decode news and information.
Emotional intelligence. The thick skin you need to weather the ups and downs of online socializing takes a while to form.
Empathy. Being able to understand others' perspectives is a critical component of healthy online relationships—and younger kids are in the process of developing this skill.
Executive function. The ability to think ahead or even understand the impact of your words on other people is still very much a work in progress. Kids with ADHD may need even more time to develop these skills.
Susceptibility. Until around age 8, kids don't understand the persuasive intent of content. Tweens can still fail to understand that content, or people, they're interacting with is trying to get them to do something.
I'm still on the fence. What else should I consider?

Though there are plenty of good reasons to wait, it's not wrong to say yes if you think your kid is ready. Social media can be fun and creative. And if all your kids' friends are on it, being left out can crimp their real-world social life. More than an age, you're looking for signs of maturity and responsibility. Your kids don't need to have all these elements in place, but if they're working on them, you can probably trust them to be OK out there, with oversight from you, of course. Here's a checklist before you say yes:

They can follow rules. Can they stick to rules such as turning over their phones at night and agreeing to spot checks?
They take responsibility for their actions. Do they blame others or get defensive when they're in trouble? This kind of attitude can cause major drama in the online world.
They're accountable with their phone. Do they show respect for the device (and the privilege of owning it) by protecting it and being careful with it?
They're resourceful. Can they think on their feet and figure out what's needed—and how to get it—when faced with a challenge? If an online friend expressed suicidal thoughts, would your kid know what to do?
They stand up for other people—but are smart enough not to get taken advantage of. You want your kid to be able to tell the difference between a friend who really needs support and a potential scammer.
They manage their time well. Are they pretty good at balancing screen time with other activities? Social media can be a real time-suck and kids need to be good at turning it off when it's no longer fun.
They have hobbies or interests that could be fostered in online environments. Do they love music, art, or fanfiction or have another passion that can connect them with people and broaden their knowledge?
What's the safest way to let my kid do social media?

With your guidance and oversight, kids can use social media safely. Here are the best practices for managing kids' social media at any age:

Ask which social media app they want, and why. This will give you a lot of information about what they already know about the app and what you both may need to learn before moving forward.

Discuss who's OK to friend and follow. It's safest to keep social media friends the same as real-world friends, but some apps make connecting so easy (such as Snapchat) that it's hard to keep a tight circle. If a stranger wants to friend your kid, they should decline (or ask you first).

Review the app's privacy settings. For starters, set the account to private. With a private account, randos can't search for and find your kid (it doesn't prevent strangers from befriending your kid in other ways).

Talk about what's OK to post and what's not OK. Make sure your kid understands the concept of ""think before you post."" Discuss the impact their posts may have on other people—and help them realize that what they put out into the world can have a different effect from what they intended. Also make sure they know not to post (or do) anything unsafe, illegal, or intimate.

Set up their account on your device. If they want to experience Instagram, but you're not ready for them to manage adding friends and selecting whom to follow, set it up on your own device to keep an eye on things.

Explain that you'll be spot-checking. If they're on their own device, you want to make sure your kid's staying safe, not getting into drama, and not spending too much time on social media. You don't have to insist on having your kid's log-ins; do the spot checks together. Likewise, you don't have to follow or friend your kid on social media (that's the kiss of death for most kids). Following one of their friends, however, is a good way to get some intel on what your kid is up to.

Check in. Ask open-ended questions about their social media lives: What's good? What's not so good? What do you wish you could change? And remember, social media is one of many contributors to kids' overall well-being.

Model social media best practices. Ask permission before posting pictures of your kids; don't get into online arguments; express the good things about your social media life (""I loved seeing pics of cousin Laura's softball game. It makes me feel close even though we don't live nearby"").

Don't forget to breathe!

A lot of times, young kids ask for stuff not because they really want it but because they're simply curious. They may be testing you, or they may actually want you to say no so they have ""permission"" not to engage in something. Try to tune into the feeling behind the ask. Be present for them and remember how much they really need you to take them seriously. Your answer may be no, but allow the discussion to happen. It'll pay off in the end. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-let-my-kid-get-social-media-like-instagram-or-snapchat-before-theyre-13",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-let-my-kid-get-social-media-like-instagram-or-snapchat-before-theyre-13
GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,How do I help prevent conflicts on social media?,APA,"Teach teens to recognize their role in cyberbullying and online hate. Acting disrespectfully or hurtfully to others just to gain likes or followers can cause serious harm to victims. Similarly, liking others’ cyberhate posts does harm. Studies show this kind of communication not only hurts victims but also other users who witness cyberhate online.

Talk to your child about recognizing examples of cyberbullying, such as posting or sending hurtful or embarrassing messages, encouraging harm, or using digital technology to make others feel excluded. Encourage teens to talk to you or another adult if they witness cyberbullying. It’s also important to talk to your child about kindness and the seriousness of engaging in cyberbullying behavior themselves.

GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,Should I Kick My Kid Off TikTok? ,Ask Lisa,"In episode 130 of the Ask Lisa Podcast, titled ""Encore: Should I Kick My Kid Off TikTok?"" the discussion revisits concerns about children's use of TikTok and whether it's advisable for parents to restrict access. Here’s a summary of the discussion and advice given:

Discussion Overview:

Cultural Relevance: TikTok is likened to television for the current younger generation, emphasizing its cultural significance and widespread acceptance among youth.
Parental Perceptions: Many parents struggle to understand the appeal of TikTok videos, which often seem pointless or unfunny to them, raising questions about the content's value.
Key Advice and Insights:

Value of TikTok Content: While the humor and content may not always be clear to adults, TikTok provides a form of distraction that can be beneficial, particularly for relaxation and temporary escape from stress.
When to Worry:
Time Management: Concerns should arise if TikTok use significantly disrupts daily responsibilities or physical activity.
Content Nature: The specific content that children are viewing is crucial; harmful or inappropriate content needs to be addressed promptly.
Understanding Algorithms: The addictive nature of TikTok can be attributed to its algorithms, which curate content based on user behavior to maximize engagement. Parents should educate their children about these mechanisms to foster critical engagement with the platform.
Social Dynamics: TikTok serves not only as a media platform but also as a social space where children share and discuss content, which enhances its appeal. This social aspect can be crucial for children feeling included in peer conversations.
Parental Actions:

Monitor Engagement: Parents are advised to keep an eye on what kind of content appears on their child's TikTok 'For You' page to understand the themes and values being promoted.
Set Appropriate Boundaries: Limiting screen time to ensure that TikTok does not replace essential activities is recommended.
Promote Critical Consumption: Encouraging children to be critical of the content they consume and to recognize the commercial motivations behind platform algorithms can help mitigate potential negative impacts.
Conclusion:
Instead of banning TikTok outright, understanding its role in children's lives and setting thoughtful boundaries may be more effective. Parents should strive for a balance where children can enjoy the benefits of digital engagement without falling prey to its pitfalls. Open communication about digital consumption and its effects is crucial to guide children in navigating their digital environments responsibly.

GENERAL BENEFITS AND HARMS,My child regularly uses a tablet at school. Should I be concerned?,AAP,"Answer: Since the One Laptop per Child initiative in 2005 and the launch of the iPad in 2010, K-12 education has been one pathway through which young children start using internet-connected technologies. During the COVID-19 pandemic, adoption of tablets and laptops became nearly universal in U.S. public K-12 school. 

Research has found that using touchscreen devices generally has a positive effect on young children’s academic learning in the classroom, especially for improving reading and math. But tablets can have different games and features. Some things for parents to consider:

Specific app features: is it interactive and at the right skill level?
App approach: is it play-based and/or does it allow for child-led exploration?
Instructional grouping/adult feedback: is the child using the app in a small group, in pairs, or individually, and do they receive feedback from a teacher on their activity?
Child age and previous experience/familiarity with touchscreens: does the child understand how to use different features of learning programs?
Unfortunately, we don’t know very much about the long-term impacts of touchscreen device use in classrooms on young children’s learning as most of the research has looked at the immediate or short-term effects of use.

What can parents do?
If you feel unsure about your young child using touchscreens in school, talk to their teacher. The good news is there are proven learning benefits when the technology is well designed and students get support from teachers.
Ask your child what types of apps or games they play on touchscreens at school. If they are playing video games that have no learning goals, you can ask that they be given another activity instead (like reading or drawing).
It’s OK to ask teachers:
Which lessons or activities are touchscreens used for?
Does the school have a goal to follow an approach like the Ed Tech triangle?
How does my child handle transition away from the touchscreen? Does this cause more problems?
Do they use a curriculum like Common Sense Education that teaches young kids about their relationship with technology?   https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/early-childhood-questions/early-childhood-questions/adolescents-sample-page/",https://www.aap.org/en/work-in-progress/social-media-and-youth-mental-health-q-and-a-portal/early-childhood-questions/early-childhood-questions/adolescents-sample-page/
OTHERS,Should I be concerned about my kid's celebrity obsession?,Common Sense,"Celebrity obsessions are a natural part of growing up. As kids enter adolescence and begin forming their identities, they begin to seek out media figures for cues on how to look and act. That's why it's a great idea to help them find positive role models.

Tweens in today's media environment can feast on an endless supply of information. They can stream every movie their idols have been in on On Demand or Netflix, track down every late-night talk show appearance on YouTube, read their bios on Wikipedia or IMDB, and look at candid photos and read gossip on sites such as Perez Hilton and Just Jared. And they can share their passion with friends on social media and fan sites.

All of this may seem excessive to you, but unless it's getting in the way of your kid's life, it's probably fine. The warning signs of a potentially dangerous celebrity crush come when kids go to extremes that have a negative impact. They may spend all their money (and ask to borrow yours) to try to look like their favorite stars. They may engage in risky body alterations to imitate them. Or they may actually inflict physical harm on themselves -- for example, cutting their skin and posting the results to social media to demonstrate the depth of their feeling.

It may not be obvious how serious your kid's celebrity obsession is, so check in with her. Watch the star's movies together, ask about the celeb, and determine whether it's all in fun or her obsession is hindering her. If it's interfering with her sleep, homework, social life, self-esteem, or relationship with you, then you may be facing a deeper issue.

Here are some ways to manage this phase of your kid's life:

Take it seriously. Tempting though it may be to mockingly declare yourself a ""Belieber"" and show off your mad dance skills, kids may feel you're belittling them.

Support it within reason. Yes, she can get tickets to the Taylor Swift concert. No, she can't follow Taylor Swift's concert tour across the country.

Talk about what comes up. In their obsessive research of a celeb, kids may turn up tidbits -- such as a star advocating legalizing marijuana -- that they want to discuss with you. Welcome these conversations as an opportunity to impart your values. Even if you disagree, aim to keep the lines of communication open. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-be-concerned-about-my-kids-celebrity-obsession",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/should-i-be-concerned-about-my-kids-celebrity-obsession
OTHERS,How can I encourage my child to not compare themselves to what they see online?,APA,"It is a normal, human trait to believe what we see. It is also normal to compare ourselves to others. Online, it has become possible to do this a lot more than we used to. For teens who are still developing a stable sense of self-esteem, this can be potentially dangerous. Young people who use social media to compare people’s appearance or seek feedback about their own personal photos are at increased risk for poorer body image, disordered eating, and depressive symptoms, particularly among girls.

Help your child understand people are selective about sharing only what they want you to see online, giving a curated view of their lives and appearance. Many photos and videos are manipulated with filters or doctored with editing tools. Yet, even when people know about those tools, their first instinct is usually to trust the content they’re viewing as true and accurate. Youth and adults need to override those automatic thoughts, and continually remind themselves that what they see online isn’t always real.",https://www.apa.org/topics/social-media-internet/social-media-literacy-teens
OTHERS,Sexy Social Media. Where Should Parents Draw the Line?,Ask Lisa,"In episode 35 of the Ask Lisa Podcast, titled ""Sexy Social Media: Where Should Parents Draw the Line?"" the discussion revolves around the complex issues surrounding teenagers' use of social media, particularly TikTok, to explore and express their identities. Lisa and Reena discuss a letter from a concerned mother about her 14-year-old daughter's behavior on social media, where she posts suggestive dance moves and attire. Lisa highlights that this behavior is quite common and has been exacerbated by the pandemic, which has increased isolation and reliance on social media for social interaction. Their advice focuses on empathetic listening, asking open-ended questions, and respecting teenagers' views while gently guiding them to consider the implications of their online presence.

Here are some practical guidelines or tips for parents on navigating conversations about social media use with their teenagers, as recommended by Lisa Damour in the podcast:
Start with Understanding: Recognize that behaviors like posting suggestive content on social media are very common among teenagers. Understand that this is a part of how they explore identity and social dynamics, especially in an era where physical social interactions might be limited.
Approach Conversations with Curiosity: When discussing social media content with your teenager, approach the conversation without judgment. Ask open-ended questions like, ""What do you think about that video?"" or ""How do you feel about the comments people are making?"" This helps open a dialogue where your child feels respected and heard.
Educate on the Impact of Content: Discuss the potential long-term implications of the content they post. Highlight how certain images and videos might be perceived by others, including peers and adults, and the possible consequences of having a digital footprint.
Discuss Online Attention and Approval: Talk about the reasons behind the desire for online approval, such as likes and comments. Explore the psychological effects of seeking validation through social media and encourage your child to find validation in real-life interactions and achievements as well.
Set Boundaries and Explain Why: Clearly define what is acceptable in your family for posting on social media. Explain why these boundaries are set, not just that they must be followed. Discuss the values behind these rules to help your teenager understand and accept them.
Promote a Balanced Self-Image: Encourage your child to engage in activities that promote a well-rounded self-image that is not solely dependent on online personas. This can include offline hobbies, sports, and educational pursuits that foster a sense of accomplishment and self-worth.
Monitor and Discuss Public Comments: Talk about the nature of public comments on social media. Discuss how to handle negative or inappropriate comments and the importance of not engaging in or encouraging such behavior.
Use Teachable Moments: If your child posts something questionable, use it as a teachable moment rather than a time for punishment. Discuss why the post might be concerning and explore alternatives that allow them to express themselves in a more appropriate way.
Apologize When Necessary: If you overreact to your child’s social media use, apologize. This shows that you respect their feelings and are open to communication. It also models responsible behavior in acknowledging mistakes.
Keep the Conversation Going: Make discussions about social media an ongoing dialogue rather than a one-time talk. Regular check-ins can help you understand your child's evolving views and experiences online.

OTHERS,My Son Messed Up. Can I Keep Him from Being Canceled?,Ask Lisa,"In the episode titled ""My Son Messed Up. How Can I Keep Him From Being Canceled?"" from the Ask Lisa Podcast, Dr. Lisa Damour offers detailed advice for parents dealing with the aftermath of their child posting controversial content online. Here are her recommendations for handling such situations:
Acknowledge the Mistake: Validate the severity of the mistake and its impact on others. It's crucial for the child to understand the implications of their actions, including the hurt they've caused.
Implement Consequences: Immediate consequences such as removing access to devices or platforms where the mistake occurred can help the child understand the gravity of their actions.
Facilitate an Apology: Guide your child in crafting a sincere apology to those affected. This may include writing letters or direct conversations, depending on the situation.
Discuss the Impact of Language: Educate your child about the power of words, especially regarding racism, homophobia, or other harmful rhetoric. Make clear that identity should never be used as a weapon.
Enhance Impulse Control: Work with your child on strategies to improve impulse control. This might include setting guidelines for social media use, practicing pausing before posting, and discussing potential posts with a parent or trusted adult before sharing.
Long-term Monitoring: Keep a close eye on your child’s online activity and communications. This monitoring should be transparent and discussed openly with the child, explaining it’s for their safety and growth.
Community Repair: Encourage your child to engage in community service or activities that promote inclusivity and understanding. This helps to rebuild trust and repair relationships within the community.
Seek Professional Help: If the behavior is part of a larger pattern of impulsivity or if there are concerns about underlying issues such as ADHD, consider consulting a mental health professional for evaluation and potential treatment.
Preventive Conversations: Regularly discuss the potential consequences of online actions with your child. Stress the importance of thinking critically about the impact of their words and actions on others.
Recovery and Redemption: Support your child in understanding that one mistake does not define them. Encourage them to learn from the experience and to use what they’ve learned to make better choices in the future.
Dr. Damour emphasizes the importance of addressing both the specific incident and the broader behaviors and attitudes that led to it. By taking comprehensive steps, parents can help their child navigate the consequences of their actions while fostering growth and understanding

OTHERS,What can parents do when they have a spouse that has a very “not healthy” lifestyle around digital use?,AAP,"To begin, it might be helpful to review this previous post on the impact parental use of digital media has on children and why parents may not be aware of this impact.  

Parents are going to vary in how aware or concerned they are about their media and phone use habits, how motivated they are to change and some may resist major changes that take away the fun and exciting part of their digital life. For these reasons, talking to a partner about media use when they don’t think it’s a problem can be a tricky conversation to have.  

Collaborative problem solving may be a good way for parents to work together towards more balanced media use. Collaborative problem solving is an evidence-based approach that focuses on understanding and addressing the root causes of challenging behaviors. Its key principles are empathy, collaboration and skill-building. The steps are: 

Find a good time to talk (not when everyone’s tired and cranky) and ask the other person for permission (e.g., “can we talk about how much media we use in our family?”). This will help build a collaborative and supportive environment and may help the person be more receptive. 
Start the conversation with empathy. Don’t lead with accusations. Ask your partner about their current feelings and concerns around digital media use, with questions like: 
How are you doing with your workload? I know you have to deal with a lot of emails. What would you rather be doing after dinner? 
I’ve noticed that you’re playing video games longer and not sleeping as much. What’s up? 
Did you hear about the Surgeon General’s advice about social media? What did you think about that? 
Share your concerns with them about the importance of having healthy media habits for their family and their own mental health, without blaming or shaming language. Let them respond with their own perspective. 
Brainstorm together ways that healthier digital media use practices can be implemented in the home. You may think about breaking it into smaller tasks at first, rather than one big change from the get-go. You’ll also want to plan something positive to do during times when you are not using media. Options might include:  
Not using tech in the car or at the dinner table and talking about the day instead. 
1-2 nights per week when your partner won’t check email at all, so you can spend time together.  
If the discussion turns into an argument, don’t argue back -- let it go and hopefully you’ve planted a seed that you can come back to another time. 
It can be hard to change a behavior that is habit-driven, and not something people are particularly aware of. Just building insight into one’s relationship with their phone is a good first step!

OTHERS,What can I say to family and friends with more lenient screen-time rules?,Common Sense,"Everyone has different screen-time rules. It can be tough to talk about because you don't want to come off as judgmental -- or maybe you just don't want to start a conflict. But if your kid is going to be spending a significant amount of time with kids whose parents have different rules, it is absolutely within your right -- and in your kid's best interest -- to explain what you're comfortable with. Soften the blow by saying, for example, ""I know I turn into a control freak when it comes to media, but it's really important to me, and since I know our kids will be friends for a long time, I want you to know where I'm coming from.""

Sometimes bending your own rules for the benefit of social harmony is the way to go, but only you can make that call. Get more ideas for telling others your screen-time rules.

Here are some of the key issues to discuss, especially as your kid gets older:

Time limits. State your preference. Say, ""I'm OK with the kids watching a movie, but I'd like them to play on their playdate too.""
Content. Tell the parents if your kid is frightened by scary stuff; say you have a particular ""thing"" about him watching shows or playing games with potentially frightening images.
Supervision. How close of an eye do the other parents keep on the kids, especially when they're on the Internet? Ask parents if they have content filters installed on their search engines.
Multiplayer games. Find out if the other kids in the house play multiplayer games. If your kid isn't familiar with them, ask if multiplayer can be turned off until he gets the hang of the game. Make sure to talk to your kid about playing online games responsibly and respectfully. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-can-i-say-to-family-and-friends-with-more-lenient-screen-time-rules",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/what-can-i-say-to-family-and-friends-with-more-lenient-screen-time-rules

Monitor Engagement: Parents are advised to keep an eye on what kind of content appears on their child's TikTok 'For You' page to understand the themes and values being promoted.
Set Appropriate Boundaries: Limiting screen time to ensure that TikTok does not replace essential activities is recommended.
Promote Critical Consumption: Encouraging children to be critical of the content they consume and to recognize the commercial motivations behind platform algorithms can help mitigate potential negative impacts.
Conclusion:
Instead of banning TikTok outright, understanding its role in children's lives and setting thoughtful boundaries may be more effective. Parents should strive for a balance where children can enjoy the benefits of digital engagement without falling prey to its pitfalls. Open communication about digital consumption and its effects is crucial to guide children in navigating their digital environments responsibly.

OTHERS,Is it OK to let my preschooler watch videos in the morning before school?,Common Sense,"Here's a secret: Almost all parents let their kids watch videos when they absolutely, positively have to get something done. That's OK. So long as your preschooler has plenty of active and imaginative playtime in addition to lots of time with a loving caregiver, she should be just fine.

Here are some easy ways to manage the time your preschooler spends watching TV or videos and to improve the quality of his or her viewing experience:

Choose mindfully. Preschool TV shows that offer real substance are out there -- you just have to find them. If you can, record the shows or add individual videos to a playlist so when an episode is over, your preschooler knows TV time is done.

Use the shows as a jumping-off point for related activities. Say there's a segment on Sesame Street about butterflies. Spend some time drawing butterflies or making them out of Play-Doh. When you can, visit a nature preserve, get some books or rent movies that delve deeper into the topic.

Split it up. Instead of two shows in the morning, make a deal with your child. One show before school and one show after (so you can make dinner!). Try these extra-gentle shows, some of which have short episodes that lend themselves to morning viewing.

Consider mixing things up. Many of the new apps available for smartphones and tablets provide a kind of hybrid experience of watching and interacting. Your preschooler is old enough to do a bit of self-directed learning for short periods.

Set some boundaries. Teach your preschooler to ask before turning on the TV or tablet and, if you can, how to turn them off after the show ends. Agree on a time or show limit.

Use it as a reward. TV time only happens once your child is dressed and ready for school.

Manage content. Consider subscribing to a specific channel your kid likes. That way, your child will watch only the shows on his or her cue rather than clicking around on YouTube. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-ok-to-let-my-preschooler-watch-videos-in-the-morning-before-school-0",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/is-it-ok-to-let-my-preschooler-watch-videos-in-the-morning-before-school-0
OTHERS,How do I talk to my kids about violence in the news?,Common Sense,"If your kid is on social media, or even just watches YouTube, you can be sure that they've already been exposed to violence on the news. Even if they don't have phones yet, they're hearing bits and pieces from friends and family or from TV, the radio, and the internet. The modern dilemma of managing your own emotions—anger, confusion, sadness— when it comes to violence while also trying to comfort and reassure your kids has become all too frequent—for all of us.

As much as we wish we could shelter our kids from the worst of the world, bad news has a way of reaching them. But even when we're struggling, our kids still look to us for answers. We are the ones who can help them process terrible news and offer hope. Read our tips below for some tips on talking about the news with your kids.

Talking helps.
Ask … and listen. Try to get a sense of what your kids know before launching into an explanation.

Younger kids may have overheard adults talking or snippets of TV or radio news, which can be scary and even traumatizing.
Older tweens and teens hear about mass shootings and other violence from social media, YouTube, TV, and friends—not always reliable sources for facts.
Try open-ended questions. Feel them out by asking, ""What did you hear?,"" ""Where did you hear that?,"" ""What do you know about it?,"" and ""What do you think about it?""

Be honest and direct. It's not necessary to go into extreme detail, but don't try to hide anything, either. Depending on your kids' ages, you can say something simple and succinct like, ""A man used a gun to hurt people."" Kids will hear all sorts of stuff from others, but you want them to hear the truth from you.

Reassure kids that they're safe and provide some closure. It's important for kids (especially younger ones) to feel that they and their immediate family aren't in danger.

Explain context and offer perspective—in small doses. Around the tween years, kids become interested in and capable of understanding complex social issues. With your life experience, knowledge, and wisdom, you can begin to explain the circumstances around issues of gun violence, racism, and political rhetoric. Not an easy task, but this is the process that gives things meaning and clarity—and it's important for kids to be able to make sense of negative and unpleasant things.

Accept their sources, but expand their horizons. Kids get most of their information on places like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Teach them to question what they see by asking themselves, ""Who made this?,"" ""Why did they make it?,"" ""What's its point of view?,"" ""What information isn't included?,"" and ""What would my friends think of this?"" These media-literacy questions help kids evaluate information, think beyond the clickbait headline or meme, and look more deeply into a topic.

Offer hope. Exposure to sad and depressing news can make kids world-weary. But knowing they can contribute something positive to the world can counter those feelings. Talk about meaningful ways you can reduce future problems, whether it's attending a rally as a family or signing a petition. Banding together helps kids feel better and recognize that they're not alone in their sadness. It also boosts the resilience they'll need their whole lives—and it may actually benefit the greater good.

What else you can do.
Develop empathy. It may not feel like much in the face of tragedy, but reading books and watching TV shows and movies that tackle social issues can help kids see the world from others' perspectives.
Discuss hate speech. Our research shows that kids are exposed to hate speech online—including racist and homophobic slurs—even more than cyberbullying. And it's not just happening on fringe sites like 8chan: Instagram memes and popular YouTubers spread it, too. Sometimes, for various reasons, kids feel connected to this kind of online cruelty. Don't be afraid to broach that subject. Ask kids what they've encountered and discuss strategies for dealing with it.
Understand the connection between violent games and actual violence. After mass shootings, politicians and pundits look for answers and frequently blame video games and other violent media. Here are the facts: For most people, playing violent video games doesn't cause them to act out. But for vulnerable folks—such as those who have experienced violence in their homes or communities—violent media could be one of many factors that contribute to aggression.
Take care.
Don't feel like you need to cover everything in one sitting. Mostly just be there for your kids. Note how they're reacting and give them extra hugs if they seem to need it. https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-talk-to-my-kids-about-violence-in-the-news",https://www.commonsensemedia.org/articles/how-do-i-talk-to-my-kids-about-violence-in-the-news
